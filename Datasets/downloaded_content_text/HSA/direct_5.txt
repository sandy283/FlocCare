1. INTRODUCTION 
 
The objective of advertisement controls for health products (“HP”) is to ensure 
that accurate and truthful information about the products is disseminated and 
to ensure that the advertisements and sales promotion activities do not 
mislead consumers or induce   unnecessary purchase or consumption of the 
HP. This is essential in helping both the public and healthcare professionals to 
make informed decisions in their choice of HP. 
 
This Guidance aims to clarify the principles of advertisement controls for 
Medical Devices (“MD”) set out in the Health Products Act (“HPA”) and the 
Health Products (Medical Device) Regulations (“the Regulations”), and should 
be read in conjunction with the HPA and the Regulations.  
 
The examples highlighted in this Guidance are not exhaustive and may be 
updated periodically. Anyone who advertise or cause any product to be 
advertised as a MD are required to comply with the HPA and the Regulations.

4. REQUIREMENTS FOR ADVERTISEMENTS OF MEDICAL DEVICES 
 
4.1 
Introduction 
 
Anyone who advertises or cause any product to be advertised as a MD is 
required to comply with Part V of the HPA, and the Regulations. The 
principles set out in the HPA and the Regulations allow information and / or 
advertisements to be disseminated for the purpose of creating awareness and 
enabling consumers to take better ownership of their own health choices. The 
advertisement controls are set out in sections 19 and 20 of the HPA and 
regulations 19 to 23 of the Regulations. 
 
4.2 
Rules for advertisements of Medical Devices 
 
Advertisements of MD do not require prior approval by the Authority. 
However, you have to ensure that the advertisements comply with the  
requirements  stated in the HPA and the Regulations.  
 
In general, no product should be advertised as a MD or that it can function as 
a MD, if it is not a MD as defined in First Schedule to the HPA. Advertisement 
of MDs must not give any false information concerning the MD or create any 
erroneous impression regarding the components, composition, specification, 
quality, safety, efficacy or uses of the MD.  Any representation relating to a 
MD must be factual and substantiated by objective evidence. 
 
Where the MD is a registered MD, you must ensure that all advertised claims 
are aligned to the indications and instructions for use (IFU) as registered with 
the HSA. Information that has not been registered or which may potentially or 
indirectly extend the usage of a registered MD must not be included in 
advertisements. This is to ensure information provided in the advertisement 
falls within the scope of the approved use of the MD.  
Advertisements of MD exempted from registration i.e. Class A medical 
devices, must be aligned and not deviate from the product owner’s 
specifications.  
 
You must also ensure that advertisements of MDs comply with any relevant 
conditions of registration that may be imposed.

HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY – HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP                Page 6 of 17      
 
4.3 
Substantiation of assertions of uniqueness and prominence 
 
Any text, emphasis, certification, award or unique feature or prominence of 
the advertised MD must be substantiated by facts or robust objective 
evidence from credible sources.  
 
Information must be presented in a balanced, objective and accurate manner 
and must be referenced by reflecting the appropriate citations (where 
relevant). Any scientific terminologies used should be in a manner that is 
readily understood by the targeted audience. 
 
Requirements for substantiation also apply to the publication of any 
testimonials, which includes "user experience’ or “user review" e.g. “After 
using this product, my condition improved within 3 weeks, I am so pleased 
with the results”. Testimonials must be current, genuine, authenticated, for 
example, via signed testimonials, and be of a typical experience. 
 
In this context, "current" would mean that the featured testimonial must be up 
to date and hold true at the time of the publication of the advertisement. 
"Typical experience" would mean the result obtained from the use of a 
product, which would likely to be attained by the average user of the product. 
You must present supporting evidence for the testimonials upon request. 
 
You must ensure that claims such as “most popular”, “number one sales” are 
verified and substantiated by relevant market data. Supporting data must be 
available and provided upon request. You must also indicate the source of 
reference, including the identity of the certifying or awarding body, and the 
date of the study or award in the advertisement. 
 
4.4  
Prohibited Advertisements 
 
4.4.1 Advertisements relating to the following are prohibited from advertising 
to the general public. 
(a) A registered “Professional Use only” medical devices; or 
(b) an unregistered “professional use only” medical device that is 
supplied in accordance with Regulation 8 or 10 of the Regulations 
 
No person shall advertise any “professional use only” medical device, 
unless the advertisement is distributed only to, or is contained in a 
publication intended for circulation mainly among, qualified practitioners.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES FOR ADVERTISEMENTS OF MEDICAL 
DEVICES   
 
Advertisers are encouraged to adhere to the following general principles so as 
to ensure that advertisement claims do not convey misleading messages that 
could lead to inappropriate use of the product or bring about undue harm to 
the public. 
 
5.1 
Discourage from medical or professional advice 
 
Advertisements of MDs should not directly or indirectly, cause the reader to 
self-diagnose or self-treat any serious diseases2. Advertisements must not 
suggest that with the use of the MD, the consumer would not need to consult 
a doctor. 
 
Advertisements should not offer to diagnose, or suggest that medical 
interventions, e.g. surgical operations, are not required by using the MD 
featured in the advertisements. 
 
5.2 
Truthfulness  
 
All product claims presented in advertisements must be well supported by 
scientific evidence. You must truthfully state the nature, quality and properties 
of the MD in your advertisements and must not directly or indirectly mislead 
the reader or give rise to any unrealistic expectations with regard to the 
safety, quality or efficacy of the MD in the advertisements by: 
                                             
1 Specified diseases and conditions listed in the Second Schedule to the Regulations include: 
Blindness, Cancer, Cataract, Conception and pregnancy, Deafness, Diabetes, Drug addiction, 
Epilepsy or fits, Frigidity, Hypertension, Impotency, Infertility, Insanity, Kidney diseases, 
Leprosy, Menstrual disorders, Paralysis, Sexual function and Tuberculosis. 
2 Serious diseases refer to conditions, including chronic / life-threatening diseases, which 
cannot be self-diagnosed / managed and where a delay in treatment may lead to death, 
hospitalisation, serious injury or deterioration of the disease / condition.

6.2 
Required content for corrective advertisements 
 
In certain cases of contraventions, a corrective advertisement will be 
considered if it is assessed that the the content of the offending advertisement 
provides inaccurate information pertaining to a MD’s safety, efficacy and 
quality which may lead to inappropriate prescribing or use of the product, e.g. 
advertising unapproved indications of a MD. 
In instances where a corrective advertisement is assessed to be necessary, 
the Authority will communicate the requirements including the content, size 
and placement and duration of the corrective advertisement to the affected 
companies via a written notice.In general, corrective advertisements are to be 
targeted at the audience who saw the offending advertisement and should 
adhere to the following content and format: 
a) An expression of regret and apology 
b) Opening statement 
This should clearly indicate that this is a corrective statement issued at 
the order of the HSA and the product concerned. E.g. “The HSA has 
ordered xxx to issue a corrective advertisement regarding the 
promotion of xxx” 
c) Statement on the breach 
This should outline how the advertisement was in breach of the Act / 
Regulations and give a description of the correct facts  
d) Description of the case 
When and where the offending advertisement was placed   
e) Contact information 
Details of the company contact should readers have any further 
questions about these matters or about the product.
