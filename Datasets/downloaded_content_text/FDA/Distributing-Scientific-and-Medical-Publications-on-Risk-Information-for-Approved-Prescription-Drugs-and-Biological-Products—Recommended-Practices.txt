I. INTRODUCTION 
15 
 
16 
This draft guidance describes the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s or Agency’s) current 
17 
thinking on recommended practices for drug manufacturers (firms) and their representatives to 
18 
follow if they choose to distribute to health care professionals2 or health care entities3 scientific 
19 
or medical journal articles that discuss new risk information for approved prescription drugs4,5,6 
20 
marketed in the United States.  The recommendations in this draft guidance are intended to 
21 
address issues specific to the distribution of new information about risks associated with a drug 
22 
that further characterizes risks identified in the approved labeling.   
23 
 
24 
The recommendations in this draft guidance are intended to apply to distribution of new risk 
25 
information (as that term is further explained in section II of this document) for drugs intended 
26 
for human and animal use. Throughout this draft guidance, the Agency provides references to 
27 
regulations and guidances specific to drugs intended for human use.  Unless otherwise indicated, 
28 
the Agency generally takes a similar approach when addressing the issues raised in this draft 
29 
guidance as they pertain to animal drugs. 
30 
 
31 
FDA’s guidance documents, including this draft guidance, do not establish legally enforceable 
32 
responsibilities.  Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should 
33 
                                                 
1 This draft guidance has been prepared by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) in cooperation 
with the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) and the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) at 
the Food and Drug Administration.  
2 For purposes of this draft guidance, health care professionals include those providing care to either human or 
animal patients.   
3 As used in this draft guidance, health care entities include hospitals, professional medical organizations, drug 
formulary committees, pharmacy benefit managers, health insurance issuers, group health plans, and Federal or 
State governmental agencies involved in the provision of health care or health insurance.  For purposes of the draft 
guidance, health care entities also include any such similar organizations involved in animal health care. 
4 As used in this draft guidance, the term drug includes drugs approved for use in humans or animals and drugs 
regulated as biological products licensed under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262(a)).    
5 For animal drugs, this draft guidance also applies to over-the-counter and Veterinary Feed Directive drugs. 
6 This guidance does not apply to products regulated as medical devices.

be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are 
34 
cited.  The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or 
35 
recommended, but not required.

II. BACKGROUND 
38 
 
39 
In February 2014, FDA issued a draft guidance titled Distributing Scientific and Medical 
40 
Publications on Unapproved New Uses—Recommended Practices (Draft Revised Reprints 
41 
Guidance).7  That draft guidance revised an earlier guidance from 2009 to clarify the Agency’s 
42 
position on manufacturer dissemination of scientific or medical publications that include 
43 
information on unapproved new uses of the manufacturer’s products. The Draft Revised Reprints 
44 
Guidance was issued to enable the public to provide comments.  Stakeholders have raised 
45 
questions regarding the Agency’s position on manufacturer dissemination of new scientific or 
46 
medical information about safety information contained in the labeling for approved drugs.  
47 
Because this concerns dissemination of new risk information related to approved uses of a drug, 
48 
this issue is distinct from the dissemination of information on unapproved new uses of approved 
49 
drugs.   
50 
 
51 
In response to those questions, the Agency is issuing this draft guidance to clarify and solicit 
52 
public comments on the Agency’s position on manufacturer dissemination of new risk 
53 
information regarding lawfully marketed drugs for approved uses to health care professionals or 
54 
health care entities.  FDA recognizes that the safety profile of a drug evolves throughout its 
55 
lifecycle as the extent of exposure to the product increases and that it can be helpful for health 
56 
care practitioners to receive significant new risk information about an approved product in a 
57 
timely manner.  FDA anticipates that the earliest distribution of new risk information will 
58 
generally involve distribution of recently published studies, as opposed to textbooks or clinical 
59 
practice guidelines. Accordingly, FDA is providing guidance for firms that choose to distribute 
60 
new risk information in the form of a reprint or digital copy of a published study. 
61 
 
62 
FDA believes that recommendations specific to the distribution of new risk information about 
63 
approved prescription drugs and biological products are needed for two reasons.  First, in general 
64 
there are differences in the purpose, nature, and reliability of the evidence used to determine the 
65 
effectiveness of a drug (e.g., to support a new intended use) and the evidence that is the basis for 
66 
the product’s risk assessment (see section III.A).  Therefore, FDA believes guidance is needed to 
67 
address the spectrum of data sources that could be appropriate for distribution to provide new 
68 
risk information. Second, new risk information may contradict or otherwise deviate from the risk 
69 
information in the approved labeling, which may cause confusion or otherwise contribute to 
70 
patient harm.  If the new information is unreliable or presented without the appropriate context, it 
71 
could influence prescribing decisions or patient monitoring in a way that could harm patients.  
72 
For example, postmarket data concerning an adverse reaction identified in the approved labeling 
73 
may suggest that the adverse reaction is less severe or occurs at lower frequency than indicated 
74 
in the approved labeling, or may call into question the basis for concluding that there is a causal 
75 
relationship between the reaction and the drug.  That information could, for example, lead to use 
76 
                                                 
7 See the 2014 draft guidance for industry entitled Distributing Scientific and Medical Publications on Unapproved 
Uses—Recommended Practices.  Although this draft guidance addresses only human products, the general principles 
are the same for animal drugs.

3 
of the drug in a patient for whom the approved labeling indicates an increased risk for the 
77 
adverse reaction.   Therefore, FDA is proposing recommendations for study or analysis and 
78 
distribution criteria to help ensure that new risk information that rebuts, mitigates, or refines risk 
79 
information in approved labeling meets appropriate standards for reliability and is presented with 
80 
appropriate disclosure of its limitations. 
81 
 
82 
For purposes of this draft guidance, the term new risk information refers to information that 
83 
becomes available after a drug is marketed that rebuts or mitigates information about a risk 
84 
already identified in the approved labeling8 or otherwise refines risk information in the approved 
85 
labeling in a way that does not indicate greater seriousness of the risk.  New risk information 
86 
could, for example, include data indicating that the severity or rate of occurrence of an event is 
87 
lower than described in the approved labeling or call into question a causal relationship between 
88 
a drug and an event in the approved labeling.  New risk information could also supplement risk 
89 
information in approved labeling derived from a general population with information about risks 
90 
in subpopulations of interest (e.g., data that show that the risk of an event in patients with hepatic 
91 
disease is similar to the risk in a general population).9  
92 
 
93 
New risk information does not include, and this guidance is not intended to apply to, information 
94 
about a newly identified risk (not previously included in the approved labeling) or new 
95 
information that indicates that a risk already identified in approved labeling is more serious than 
96 
is reflected in that labeling. 
97 
 
98 
Nothing in this draft guidance is intended to change a firm’s existing obligations under the 
99 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) 
100 
and implementing regulations to update its approved labeling, to accurately reflect what is 
101 
known about the safety profile of the drug, to ensure that the labeling is not false or misleading, 
102 
or for other reasons.10

III. OVERVIEW OF FDA RISK ASSESSMENT—PRE- AND POSTMARKET  
105 
 
106 
A. Premarket Risk Assessment  
107 
 
108 
                                                 
8 As used in this draft guidance, approved labeling refers to the labeling reviewed and approved under section 351 
of the Public Health Service Act, or section 505 or 512 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or a 
conditional approval under section 571 of such act.  See 21 CFR 201.56, 201.57, 201.100, and 201.105. 
9 The term “new risk information” for purposes of this draft guidance should not be confused with the term “new 
safety information,” as defined in section 505-1(b)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) for 
purposes of FDA determinations about (among other things) the exercise of its authority under section 505(o)(4) of 
the FD&C Act to require and, if necessary, order labeling changes if it becomes aware of new safety information it 
believes should be included in the labeling of a drug.  Although in some cases, the same information may constitute 
new risk information as used in this draft guidance and new safety information as defined in section 505-1(b)(3) of 
the FD&C Act, this draft guidance is not intended to address new safety information nor the implementation of 
section 505(o)(4).  For information regarding section 505(o)(4), see the 2013 guidance for industry entitled Safety 
Labeling Changes—Implementation of Section 505(o)(4) of the FD&C Act.   
10 See, e.g., 21 CFR 201.56(a)(2) (“[approved] labeling must be updated when new information becomes available 
that causes the labeling to become inaccurate, false, or misleading”), 21 CFR 314.70 and 601.12 (concerning 
supplements and other changes to an approved application, including labeling), and 21 CFR 514.8(c) (concerning 
supplements and other changes to an approved application for a new animal drug, including labeling).

As reflected in the statutory new drug and new animal drug approval standards in sections 505 
109 
and 512 of the FD&C Act and the standard for licensure under section 351 of the PHS Act, the 
110 
evidence that is the basis for the risk assessment of a drug differs from the evidence that is the 
111 
basis for an effectiveness determination.  The effectiveness determination is generally intended 
112 
to evaluate a drug’s positive effect based on adequate and well-controlled trials designed to 
113 
evaluate a specific efficacy variable (or a discrete number of efficacy variables) for the purpose 
114 
of distinguishing the effect of the drug from other influences.11  In contrast, FDA’s premarket 
115 
risk assessment is intended to identify and characterize the nature, frequency, and severity of the 
116 
usually broad spectrum of adverse events and other risks associated with the use of a product 
117 
based on a range of data sources.  For human drugs, the supporting data are generally not derived 
118 
from studies designed to test a specific safety hypothesis.  The assessment is based largely on 
119 
observations of adverse events from studies intended to assess effectiveness and includes all 
120 
patients exposed to the investigational drug during its development.  For animal drugs, there are 
121 
generally data from safety studies in the target animal, in addition to observations of adverse 
122 
events from studies intended to assess effectiveness.12  For both human and animal drugs, 
123 
relevant data are weighted and integrated, based on the nature and reliability of the data sources, 
124 
into a coherent assessment of what adverse reactions are reasonably associated with the use of a 
125 
product and, to the extent possible, their frequency and severity.13       
126 
 
127 
Risk information is presented in various sections of the approved labeling.  The ADVERSE 
128 
REACTIONS section is the repository for all adverse reactions associated with a drug.  
129 
Depending on the seriousness or other important clinical implications of an adverse reaction, it 
130 
may also be discussed in greater detail in other labeling sections, in particular the WARNINGS 
131 
AND PRECAUTIONS, CONTRAINDICATIONS, and BOXED WARNING sections.14  For 
132 
example, the ADVERSE REACTIONS section of approved human drug labeling is explicitly 
133 
required to “describe the overall adverse reaction profile of the drug based on the entire safety 
134 
database.”15  The threshold for inclusion of an adverse event16 in approved human drug labeling 
135 
is a determination that “there is some basis to believe there is a causal relationship between the 
136 
drug and the occurrence of the adverse event.”17  Whether there is some basis to believe there is 
137 
a causal relationship is a matter of judgment based on factors such as: (1) the frequency of 
138 
reporting of the event, (2) whether the adverse event rate for a drug exceeds the placebo rate, (3) 
139 
the extent of dose-response, (4) the extent to which the adverse event is consistent with the 
140 
pharmacology of the drug, (5) the timing of the event relative to the time of drug exposure, (6) 
141 
                                                 
11 21 CFR 314.126; 21 CFR 514.117 
12 Target animals are the specific animals (e.g., species, class, etc.) for which the drug is intended for use.  This draft 
guidance pertains only to risk information relevant to target animal safety.  The Agency conducts a separate review 
with respect to the human food safety of drugs given to food animals which takes different factors into account.   
13 See the 2005 guidance for industry entitled Premarketing Risk Assessment for a more detailed discussion of 
premarket assessment of safety to support drug approval.     
14 See, e.g., the 2011 guidance for industry entitled Warnings and Precautions, Contraindications, and Boxed 
Warnings Sections of Labeling for Human Drug and Biological Products—Content and Format. 
15 21 CFR 201.57(c)(7) 
16 The term adverse event refers to the universe of untoward medical occurrences observed in conjunction with 
exposure to a drug, whether or not considered drug-related (see 21 CFR 312.32(a)).  Adverse reactions are a subset 
of adverse events for which there is evidence to conclude there is some basis to believe there is a causal relationship 
between the drug and the adverse event (see 21 CFR 201.57(c)(7)).   
17 21 CFR 201.57(c)(7)

5 
the existence of dechallenge and rechallenge experience, and (7) whether the adverse event is 
142 
known to be caused by related drugs.18   
143 
 
144 
As these factors suggest, the strength of the evidence of a causal relationship between a drug and 
145 
an adverse event (and, where applicable, the assessment of rate of occurrence) may vary across 
146 
different drugs and diseases, and across different adverse reactions for the same drug, based on 
147 
the types of data sources available in the premarket safety database, the size of the premarket 
148 
population exposed to the drug, the pharmacology of the drug, and the nature of the event.  
149 
Placebo-controlled and dose-response studies, if available, will generally be more informative 
150 
than active-control and single-arm studies, and a larger premarket population will generally be 
151 
more informative than a smaller one.  Also, certain types of events are more strongly suggestive 
152 
of a causal relationship than others.  For example, a single occurrence, or a small number of 
153 
occurrences, of a hypersensitivity reaction to a drug in which the patient was rechallenged with 
154 
the drug and reacted, or an event that very rarely occurs spontaneously in a population not 
155 
exposed to a drug (e.g., agranulocytosis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome), can provide strong 
156 
evidence of a causal relationship.  However, a limited number of occurrences of a serious event 
157 
that would be expected to occur in the study population independent of exposure to a drug (e.g., 
158 
cardiovascular events in an elderly study population) provide more ambiguous evidence of a 
159 
causal relationship.  Therefore, a premarket risk assessment, although a thorough and rigorous 
160 
assessment of the available safety data from the entire population exposed to a drug prior to 
161 
marketing, may be limited in its ability to fully characterize a drug’s safety profile by the nature 
162 
of the supporting data and the size of the population exposed.   
163 
 
164 
B. Postmarket Risk Assessment 
165 
 
166 
Because of the inherent limitations of the premarket risk assessment, postmarketing 
167 
pharmacovigilance activities—both active (new controlled and epidemiologic studies) and 
168 
passive (spontaneous reports)—may be critically important to developing and refining the safety 
169 
profile of a drug.  For example, new adverse reactions may be identified through postmarket 
170 
reports of adverse events, particularly rare serious events that occur at a frequency too low to 
171 
have been identified and characterized premarketing.  Also, new data and information may be 
172 
developed to further characterize previously identified adverse events.  The types of data that can 
173 
contribute to further developing the safety profile of a drug after marketing include data from 
174 
controlled trials intended to evaluate a specific safety endpoint, controlled and uncontrolled trials 
175 
evaluating efficacy (e.g., new uses), pooled analyses of new and existing risk information from 
176 
controlled trials, epidemiologic studies evaluating a particular safety endpoint or safety 
177 
generally, registries, and analyses of postmarketing reports of adverse events obtained through 
178 
active (e.g., Sentinel) or passive surveillance processes.  In some cases, additional new studies—
179 
controlled trials or epidemiologic studies—may be postmarketing requirements or commitments 
180 
made at the time of approval or thereafter (e.g., a cardiovascular outcome study is often required 
181 
for a new drug to treat type 2 diabetes).19           
182

and Biological Products—Content and Format for a more detailed discussion of how to identify adverse reactions 
for inclusion in approved labeling.

Assessment for a more detailed discussion of postmarketing safety assessment.

IV. CRITERIA FOR DETERMINING WHETHER NEW RISK INFORMATION IS 
184 
APPROPRIATE FOR DISTRIBUTION TO HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS 
185 
AND HEALTH CARE ENTITIES 
186 
 
187 
FDA recognizes that the safety profile of a drug evolves throughout its lifecycle as the extent of 
188 
exposure to the product increases and that it can be helpful for health care practitioners to receive 
189 
significant new risk information about an approved product in a timely manner.  Firms may 
190 
distribute to healthcare entities and healthcare professionals new risk information under 
191 
appropriate circumstances, even if such data are not consistent with the risk information 
192 
currently in approved labeling.  Before distributing new risk information that suggests that an 
193 
adverse reaction or other risk currently in approved labeling is not causally related to a drug or is 
194 
less consequential than is reflected in the labeling, or that otherwise refines the characterization 
195 
of an adverse reaction identified in approved labeling, firms should carefully consider the 
196 
reliability and persuasiveness of the data.  As discussed in section III.A, there are cases in which 
197 
even one occurrence of an adverse event can provide strong evidence that the drug caused the 
198 
event.  In contrast, where existing evidence provides some basis to believe that there is a causal 
199 
relationship between an event and a drug,20 the evidence offered to overcome that prior showing 
200 
should generally be from a study or analysis in a population large enough to detect a meaningful 
201 
difference in the rate of occurrence of an event in patients who are exposed to the drug versus 
202 
those who are not.   
203 
 
204 
FDA does not intend to object to the distribution of new risk information that rebuts, mitigates, 
205 
or refines risk information in the approved labeling, and is distributed by a firm in the form of a 
206 
reprint or digital copy of a published study, if the study or analysis and the manner of distribution 
207 
meet the principles set out below.  Distribution of information that is not consistent with this 
208 
guidance may render the labeling of a drug false or misleading under section 502(a) of the 
209 
FD&C Act. 
210 
 
211 
DATA SOURCE 
212 
 
213 
• The study or analysis should meet accepted design and other methodologic standards for 
214 
the type of study or analysis (e.g., provides a clear description of the hypothesis tested, 
215 
acknowledges and accounts for potential bias and multiplicity) and should be sufficiently 
216 
well-designed and informative to merit consideration in assessing the implications of a 
217 
risk.    
218 
 
219 
• To rebut a prior determination (reflected in the approved labeling) that there is some basis 
220 
to believe there is causal relationship between the drug and the occurrence of an adverse 
221 
event, or to otherwise mitigate a described risk, the study or analysis should also be at 
222 
least as persuasive as the data sources that underlie the existing risk assessment of 
223 
causality, severity, and/or incidence of the adverse reaction as reflected in approved 
224

• The conclusions of the study or analysis should give appropriate weight and 
230 
consideration to, and should be a fair characterization of, all relevant information in the 
231 
safety database, including contrary or otherwise inconsistent findings.  As discussed 
232 
above, there is a broad spectrum of potential data sources that can contribute in some way 
233 
to characterization of a product’s safety; new risk information should be considered in 
234 
light of all relevant existing information and integrated with that data to the extent 
235 
possible. 
236 
 
237 
• The study or analysis should be published in an independent, peer-reviewed journal.

241 
• The reprint or digital copy should be accompanied by a cover sheet that clearly and 
242 
prominently discloses: 
243 
 
244 
o The study design, critical findings, and significant methodologic or other 
245 
limitations of the study or analysis that may limit the persuasiveness or scope of 
246 
findings that rebut, mitigate, or refine risk information in the approved labeling. 
247 
Limitations should be discussed in relation to the specific circumstances of the 
248 
study and its conclusions about a risk.21 
249 
 
250 
o That the information is not consistent with certain risk information in the 
251 
approved labeling (should specifically identify the inconsistent information). 
252 
 
253 
o That FDA has not reviewed the data. 
254 
 
255 
o Any financial interests or affiliations between the study author(s) and the firm.

• The reprint or digital copy should be accompanied by the approved labeling for the 
258 
product. 
259 
 
260 
• The reprint or digital copy, when distributed, should be separate from any promotional 
261 
material. 
262 
 
263 
• Any statements made by a representative of the firm to a recipient concerning the reprint 
264 
should be consistent with its content and the information in the disclosure cover sheet.

21 Randomized, controlled trials designed to assess relative risk of occurrence of an adverse reaction would generally 
provide the most persuasive information, although they can have quality and interpretation problems.  Other types of 
data sources that could be relied on to rebut, mitigate, or refine risk information, such as pharmacoepidemiologic 
studies or meta-analyses, will generally warrant more extensive discussions of their limitations.
