This draft guidance, when finalized, will represent the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s or 
7 
Agency’s) current thinking on this topic.  It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and 
8 
does not operate to bind FDA or the public.  You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies 
9 
the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.  If you want to discuss an alternative 
10 
approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance.  If you cannot identify the 
11 
appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.

I. 
INTRODUCTION  
16 
 
17 
This draft guidance is intended to describe FDA’s current thinking about how manufacturers, packers, 
18 
and distributors (firms), that may either be the applicant or acting on behalf of the applicant, of 
19 
prescription human and animal drug and biological products (drugs) can fulfill regulatory requirements 
20 
for postmarketing submissions1 of interactive promotional media for their FDA-approved products.2,3  
21 
For the purposes of this guidance, the phrase interactive promotional media includes modern tools and 
22 
technologies that often allow for real-time communications and interactions (e.g., blogs, microblogs, 
23 
social networking sites, online communities, and live podcasts) that firms use to promote their drugs.  
24 
Although some interactive promotional media are substantially similar in presentation and content to 
25 
certain traditional promotional media, such as print media, FDA recognizes that in other cases they 
26 
possess certain unique technological features and offer novel presentation and content features.  This draft 
27 
guidance describes FDA’s current thinking on what the Agency considers to be interactive promotional 
28 
media and outlines the considerations taken into account in determining if product communications using 
29 
interactive technologies are subject to FDA’s postmarketing submission requirements.  Furthermore, this 
30 
draft guidance provides FDA’s recommendations for how firms can fulfill the regulatory requirement to 
31 
submit postmarketing promotional materials to the FDA in a practical manner to address the potential 
32 
                                                     
1 21 CFR 314.81(b)(3)(i); 21 CFR 601.12(f)(4); and 21 CFR 514.80(b)(5)(ii).  See Section III for a detailed 
description of these postmarketing submission requirements. 
2 This draft guidance has been prepared by the Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (OPDP) in the Center for 
Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) in consultation with the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research 
(CBER) and the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM). 
3 The recommendations in this draft guidance also apply to biological products that are approved for marketing 
under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act).  Because each biological product also meets the 
definition of “drug” or “device” under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), it is also subject to 
provisions of the FD&C Act applicable to drugs or devices, as well as the regulations implementing these 
provisions, except that a biological product licensed under section 351 of the PHS Act is not required to have an 
approved new drug application under section 505 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 355).  See PHS Act section 351(j), 
(42 U.S.C. 262(j)).  The recommendations in this draft guidance do not apply to veterinary biological products 
regulated under the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act (21 U.S.C. 151, et seq.) by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

volume of real-time information that is continuously posted and shared through various interactive 
33 
promotional media platforms. 
34 
 
35 
The organization of the draft guidance is as follows: after some background information regarding 
36 
postmarketing submission requirements (Section II), a brief legal overview of statutory and regulatory 
37 
requirements for labeling and advertising is presented, including postmarketing submission requirements 
38 
(III).  Then, considerations related to submission of interactive promotional media are discussed with 
39 
some illustrative examples (IV), and, finally, FDA’s recommendations for submitting such promotional 
40 
materials are provided (V).   
41 
 
42 
FDA’s guidance documents, including this draft guidance, do not establish legally enforceable rights or 
43 
responsibilities.  Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be 
44 
viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited.  The use 
45 
of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not 
46 
required.  
47 
 
48 
II. 
BACKGROUND 
 
49 
 
50 
FDA’s regulation of prescription drug product promotion extends both to promotional activities that are 
51 
carried out by the firm itself, and to promotion conducted on the firm’s behalf.  In determining whether 
52 
the firm is accountable for a communication about its product(s), the Agency considers whether the firm 
53 
or anyone acting on its behalf is influencing or controlling the product promotional activity or 
54 
communication in whole or part.  Firms may have a variety of options for how much control they exert 
55 
over activities that utilize interactive promotional media, regardless of whether the promotional activity 
56 
occurs on firm-sponsored or third-party venues.  For example, a firm may promote its products through 
57 
product websites, discussion boards, chat rooms, or other public electronic forums that it maintains and 
58 
over which it has full control.  In addition, third-party sites (i.e., websites and other venues that are either 
59 
entirely independent of a firm’s control and influence, or not fully controlled by a firm) may promote a 
60 
firm’s products.   
61 
 
62 
As part of the postmarketing reporting requirements under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
63 
(FD&C Act), application holders are required to submit all promotional labeling and advertising pieces at 
64 
the time of initial dissemination of the labeling and at the time of initial publication of the advertisement 
65 
for a drug.  However, for some interactive promotional media, submission “at the time of initial 
66 
dissemination” may pose a challenge for firms, particularly when these media communicate information 
67 
that is displayed in real time.  While “at the time of initial dissemination” does not refer to submissions on 
68 
a weekly, monthly, or other routine schedule, FDA intends to exercise its enforcement discretion under 
69 
certain circumstances due to the high volume of information that may be posted within short periods of 
70 
time using interactive promotional media that allow for real-time communications.  If a firm submits 
71 
interactive promotional media in the manner described in this draft guidance, FDA intends to exercise 
72 
enforcement discretion regarding the regulatory requirements for postmarketing submissions related to 
73 
promotional labeling and advertising. 
74 
 
75 
III.  
LEGAL OVERVIEW OF STATUTORY AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR 
76 
LABELING AND ADVERTISING 
77 
 
78 
Under the FD&C Act, the Agency has responsibility for regulating the manufacture, sale, and distribution 
79 
of drugs in the United States.  This authority includes oversight of the labeling and advertising of 
80 
prescription drugs and biologics (21 U.S.C. 352 (a) & (n)). 
81

82 
Section 201(m) of the FD&C Act defines labeling as “all labels and other written, printed, or graphic 
83 
matter (1) upon any article or any of its containers or wrappers, or (2) accompanying such article” (21 
84 
U.S.C. 321(m)).4  The U.S. Supreme Court has explained that the language “accompanying such article” 
85 
in the “labeling” definition is interpreted broadly, to include materials that supplement or explain an 
86 
article.  No physical attachment between the materials and the article is necessary; rather, it is the textual 
87 
relationship between the items that is significant.  Kordel v. United States, 335 U.S. 345, 350 (1948).  
88 
FDA generally recognizes two types of labeling for drugs: FDA-required labeling and promotional 
89 
labeling.  Promotional labeling is generally any labeling, other than the FDA-required labeling, that is 
90 
devised for promotion of the product.  Examples of promotional labeling pieces are described at 21 CFR 
91 
202.1(l)(2).     
92 
 
93 
Also, under the FD&C Act and FDA's implementing regulations, the applicant shall submit specimens of 
94 
mailing pieces and any other labeling or advertising devised for promotion of the drug product at the time 
95 
of initial dissemination of the labeling and at the time of initial publication of the advertisement for a 
96 
prescription drug product.  Each submission is required to be accompanied by a completed Form FDA 
97 
2253 (Transmittal of Advertisements and Promotional Labeling for Drugs for Human Use) (21 CFR 
98 
314.81(b)(3)(i) and 21 CFR 601.12(f)(4)). 
99 
 
100 
For prescription and over-the-counter new animal drugs, the applicant must submit at the time of initial 
101 
dissemination one set of specimens of mailing pieces and other labeling.  For prescription new animal 
102 
drugs, the applicant must also submit one set of specimens of any advertisement at the time of initial 
103 
publication or broadcast.  Each submission of promotional labeling or advertisements must be 
104 
accompanied by a completed Form FDA 2301 (21 CFR 514.80(b)(5)(ii)). 
105 
 
106 
IV. 
FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING POSTMARKETING SUBMISSION 
107 
REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERACTIVE PROMOTIONAL MEDIA 
108 
 
109 
FDA considers the following in determining a firm’s responsibility for submitting interactive promotional 
110 
media to FDA as required by postmarketing submission requirements: 
111 
 
112 
1. 
A firm is responsible for product promotional communications on sites that are owned, controlled, 
113 
created, influenced, or operated by, or on behalf of, the firm. 
114 
 
115 
Such product promotional communications may include firm-sponsored microblogs (e.g., Twitter), social 
116 
networking sites (e.g., Facebook), firm blogs, and other sites that are under the control or influence of the 
117 
firm.  In determining whether a firm must submit promotional material about its product(s) to FDA, the 
118 
Agency considers whether the firm, or anyone acting on its behalf, is influencing or controlling the 
119 
promotional activity or communication in whole or part.  Thus, a firm is responsible if it exerts influence 
120 
over a site in any particular, even if the influence is limited in scope.  For example, if the firm 
121 
collaborates on or has editorial, preview, or review privilege over the content provided, then it is 
122 
responsible for that content. 
123 
 
124 
Example 1:  A firm provides on its product website an online forum that gives users the opportunity to 
125 
post comments about the use of its product.  In this case, the firm is responsible for submitting to FDA the 
126 
product website to meet the postmarketing submission requirements because the firm created, owns, or 
127 
                                                     
4 See also 21 CFR 1.3(a).

operates the website.  (See the discussion regarding user generated content (UGC) on firm-owned or firm-
128 
controlled venues at the end of this section.) 
129 
 
130 
2. 
Under certain circumstances, a firm is responsible for promotion on third-party sites.   
131 
 
132 
A firm is responsible for promotion on a third-party site if the firm has any control or influence on the 
133 
third-party site, even if that influence is limited in scope.  For example, if a firm collaborates, or has 
134 
editorial, preview, or review privilege, then it is responsible for its promotion on the site and, as such, that 
135 
site is subject to submission to FDA to meet postmarketing submission requirements.  However, if a firm 
136 
provides only financial support (e.g., through an unrestricted educational grant) and has no other control 
137 
or influence on that site, then the firm is not responsible for information on a third-party site, and has no 
138 
obligation to submit the content to FDA.  Furthermore, if a firm is merely providing promotional 
139 
materials to a third-party site but does not direct the placement of the promotion within the site and has no 
140 
other control or influence on that site, the firm is responsible only for the content it places there and, thus, 
141 
is responsible only for submitting to FDA promotional content that was disseminated on that site. 
142 
 
143 
Example 2:  A firm does not have any control of, or influence on, information on an independent third-
144 
party site but chooses to promote its product on this site (e.g., by providing specific promotional content 
145 
such as firm-initiated UGC).  In this situation, to meet postmarketing submission requirements, the firm is 
146 
responsible for submitting to FDA the promotional content it provided to the site.  (See Section V for 
147 
FDA’s recommendations for how to submit.)  
148 
 
149 
Example 3:  A firm makes suggestions on the placement of its promotional messages on an independent 
150 
third-party site.  Because the firm influenced the placement of its promotion within the third-party site, 
151 
the firm is responsible for submitting to FDA the promotion, along with the surrounding pages, to 
152 
adequately provide context to facilitate the review of the third-party site, in order to fulfill the 
153 
postmarketing submission requirements.   
154 
 
155 
In summary, regardless of financial support, if a firm has any control of, or influence on, the third-party 
156 
site, even if limited in scope, it is responsible for submission to FDA to meet the postmarketing 
157 
submission requirements. 
158 
 
159 
3. 
A firm is responsible for the content generated by an employee or agent who is acting on behalf of 
160 
the firm to promote the firm’s product. 
161 
 
162 
FDA’s regulation of prescription drug product promotion extends both to promotional activities that are 
163 
carried out by the firm itself, and to promotion conducted on the firm’s behalf.  Therefore, a firm is 
164 
responsible for the content generated by its employees or any agents acting on behalf of the firm who 
165 
promote the firm’s product.  For example, if an employee or agent of a firm, such as a medical science 
166 
liaison or paid speaker (e.g., a key opinion leader) acting on the firm’s behalf, comments on a third-party 
167 
site about the firm’s product, the firm is responsible for the content its employee or agent provides.  A 
168 
firm is also responsible for the content on a blogger’s site if the blogger is acting on behalf of the firm.  
169 
Therefore, a firm is responsible for UGC and communications of its employees or anyone acting on 
170 
behalf of the firm and, as such, those materials are subject to submission to FDA to meet the 
171 
postmarketing submission requirements. 
172 
 
173 
All UGC meeting these parameters for interactive promotional media should be submitted to the FDA as 
174 
recommended below in Section V. 
175 
 
176

5 
Example 4:  A sales representative acting on behalf of a firm posts comments about the innovative release 
177 
mechanism of the firm’s product on an independent third-party site.  Because the sales representative is 
178 
acting on behalf of the firm, the firm is responsible for submitting the comments to FDA to meet the 
179 
postmarketing submission requirements. 
180 
 
181 
Example 5:  A representative of a firm, such as a blogger paid by the firm, maintains a blog about the 
182 
firm’s product.  The firm is responsible for submitting the blog to FDA to meet the postmarketing 
183 
submission requirements. 
184 
 
185 
FDA recommends that a firm be transparent in disclosing its involvement on a site by clearly identifying 
186 
the UGC and communications of its employees or third parties acting on behalf of the firm.  This could be 
187 
achieved by inclusion of the firm's identifier (e.g., name or logo) as part of the communication.  However, 
188 
a firm generally is not responsible for UGC that is truly independent of the firm (i.e., is not produced by, 
189 
or on behalf of, or prompted by the firm in any particular).5  FDA will not ordinarily view UGC on firm-
190 
owned or firm-controlled venues such as blogs, message boards, and chat rooms as promotional content 
191 
on behalf of the firm as long as the user has no affiliation with the firm and the firm had no influence on 
192 
the UGC. 
193 
 
194 
FDA recommends that a firm submit to the Agency on Form FDA 2253 or Form FDA 2301 specimens of 
195 
the interactive promotional media being used on the firm-owned or firm-controlled venue (e.g., blog, 
196 
message board, or chat room), as described below in Section V.  FDA recognizes that firms may be 
197 
submitting both firm-generated and independent UGC on Form FDA 2253 or Form FDA 2301 as both 
198 
firm-generated and independent UGC may be dispersed throughout the interactive promotional venue.    
199 
 
200 
V. 
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SUBMITTING INTERACTIVE PROMOTIONAL MEDIA 
201 
 
202 
FDA recognizes the challenges of submitting promotional materials that display real-time information 
203 
and, in this section, recommendations for submitting interactive promotional media are provided.  If a 
204 
firm submits interactive promotional media in the manner described in this draft guidance, FDA intends 
205 
to exercise enforcement discretion regarding the regulatory requirements for postmarketing submissions 
206 
related to promotional labeling and advertising.  However, the Agency’s expectations for submitting static 
207 
promotional materials (e.g., sites that do not allow real-time communications and emails with 
208 
predetermined content) that are substantially similar to traditional promotional materials in presentation 
209 
and content remain unchanged.6 
210 
 
211 
Unless otherwise specified in this guidance, the principles set forth below apply to the submission of 
212 
interactive promotional media that display real-time communications, regardless of the target audience.  
213 
                                                     
5 Cf. 47 U.S.C. 230(c)(1) (“no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or 
speaker of any information provided by another information content provider”).  The Communications Decency Act 
further defines “information content provider” as someone “responsible, in whole or in part, for the creation or 
development of information provided through the Internet or any other interactive computer service.” 47 U.S.C. 
230(f)(3). 
6 Please note that the Agency expects that submissions of static promotional materials should remain unchanged.  
For example, a firm should submit its entire static product website at the time of first use.  If the firm then updates 
one page or section of this static product website, the firm can submit only the updated page or section with a cross-
reference to the original submission of the website noted on Form FDA 2253 or Form FDA 2301, including the date 
of the original submission.  If the website is substantially revised, the firm should submit the revised website in its 
entirety.

The examples and recommendations provided are intended to provide guidance and illustrate possible 
214 
approaches.  Firms are free to use alternative approaches if these approaches satisfy the requirements of 
215 
the statute and regulations.   
216 
 
217 
1. 
At the time of initial display, a firm should submit in its entirety all sites for which it is responsible 
218 
on Form FDA 2253 or Form FDA 2301.  For example, the firm should submit the comprehensive 
219 
static product website with the addition of the interactive or real-time components.7   
220 
 
221 
The firm should include annotations to describe the parts that are interactive and allow for real-time 
222 
communications.  Any subsequent changes should be annotated and resubmitted to the Agency on Form 
223 
FDA 2253 or Form FDA 2301 at the time of initial display (i.e., resubmission).  The firm should also 
224 
provide a cross-reference by noting the submission date of the most recent version of the site in the 
225 
comments section of the form.  However, after the initial submission or resubmission, if the site is 
226 
publically accessible without restrictions such as a password or subscription (“non-restricted”) and  
227 
remains unchanged other than displaying real-time information, FDA does not intend to object if the firm 
228 
submits to the Agency on Form FDA 2253 or Form FDA 2301 an updated listing of the site that does not 
229 
include screenshots or other visual representations of the actual interactive or real-time communication, as 
230 
described in number 3 below. If access to the site is restricted (e.g., is password protected or a 
231 
subscription is required), see number 4 below. 
232 
 
233 
2. 
For third-party sites on which a firm’s participation is limited to interactive or real-time 
234 
communications, a firm should submit the home page of the third-party site, along with the 
235 
interactive page within the third-party site and the firm’s first communication, on Form FDA 2253 or 
236 
Form FDA 2301 at the time of initial display.   
237 
 
238 
The firm may include any annotations that describe its communications within the third-party site.  After 
239 
the initial submission, if the firm remains an active participant on the third-party site, and that site is non-
240 
restricted, FDA does not intend to object if the firm submits to the Agency on Form FDA 2253 or Form 
241 
FDA 2301 an updated listing of the site that does not include screenshots or other visual representations 
242 
of the actual interactive or real-time communication, as described in number 3 below.  If access to the site 
243 
is restricted, see number 4 below. 
244

3. 
Once every month, a firm should submit an updated listing of all non-restricted sites for which it is 
246 
responsible or in which it remains an active participant and that include interactive or real-time 
247 
communications.  Firms need not submit screenshots or other visual representations of the actual 
248 
interactive or real-time communications with the monthly updates.

250 
Once every month, the firm should submit a Form FDA 2253 or Form FDA 2301 for the non-restricted 
251 
sites for which the firm is responsible or in which it remains an active participant and that include 
252 
interactive or real-time communications.  Multiple sites and the corresponding documents can be 
253 
submitted with a single Form FDA 2253 or Form FDA 2301.  Firms should include a separate document 
254 
for each site which includes the site name, URL, and date range, as well as a cross-reference to the date of 
255 
the most recent submission of the site.  Screenshots or other visual representations of the actual 
256 
interactive or real-time communications need not be submitted with the monthly updates if the site is non-
257 
                                                     
7 It is preferable for the firm to submit the interactive or real-time communications in an archivable format that 
allows FDA to view and interact with the submission in the same way as the end user (e.g., working links).  
Alternatively, firms should submit screen shots or other visual representations.

restricted.  The appropriate FDA center (CDER, CBER, or CVM) should be informed via general 
258 
correspondence on the first day the firm ceases to be active on a site.

However, if a site has restricted access and, as such, FDA may not have access to the site, a firm   
261 
should submit all content related to the discussion (e.g., all UGC about the topic), which may or may 
262 
not include independent UGC, to adequately provide context to facilitate the review.  Screenshots or 
263 
other visual representations of the actual site, including the interactive or real-time communications, 
264 
should be submitted monthly on Form FDA 2253 or Form FDA 2301.

When submitting the site, FDA recommends that a firm take formatting factors (e.g., appearance, 
267 
layout, visual impression) into consideration to enable the Agency to view the communications as a 
268 
whole.
