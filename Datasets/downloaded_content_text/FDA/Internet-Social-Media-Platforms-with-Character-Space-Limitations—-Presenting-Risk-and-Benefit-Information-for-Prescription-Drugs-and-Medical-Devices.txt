This draft guidance, when finalized, will represent the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s or 
8 
Agency’s) current thinking on this topic.  It does not create or confer any rights for or on any 
9 
person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public.  You may use an alternative approach if the 
10 
approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.  If you want to 
11 
discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
17 
 
18 
This draft guidance is intended to describe FDA’s current thinking about how manufacturers, 
19 
packers, and distributors (firms) of prescription human and animal drugs (drugs) and medical 
20 
devices for human use (devices)2 that choose to present benefit information should present both 
21 
benefit and risk information within advertising and promotional labeling (sometimes collectively 
22 
referred to in this guidance document as “promotion”) of their FDA-regulated medical products on 
23 
electronic/digital platforms that are associated with character space limitations—specifically on the 
24 
Internet and through social media or other technological venues (Internet/social media).   Examples 
25 
of Internet/social media platforms with character space limitations include online microblog 
26 
messaging (e.g., messages on Twitter or “tweets,” which are currently limited to 140 character 
27 
spaces per tweet) and online paid search (e.g., “sponsored links” on search engines such as Google 
28 
and Yahoo, which have limited character spaces as well as other platform-imposed 
29 
                                                 
1 This draft guidance has been prepared by the Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (OPDP) in the Center for Drug 
Evaluation and Research (CDER) in consultation with the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), the 
Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM), and the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH). 
2 The recommendations in this draft guidance also apply to biological products that are approved for marketing under 
section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act).  Because each biological product also meets the definition of 
“drug” or “device” under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), it is also subject to regulation under 
provisions of the FD&C Act applicable to drugs or devices, as well as the regulations implementing these provisions, 
except that a biological product licensed under section 351 of the PHS Act is not required to have an approved new 
drug application under section 505 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 355).  See PHS Act section 351(j) (42 U.S.C. 262(j)).  
References to “drugs” and “devices” in this guidance therefore also include biological products that fall within each of 
those definitions.  The recommendations in this draft guidance do not apply to veterinary biological products regulated 
under the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act (21 U.S.C. 151, et seq.) by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  This draft guidance 
does not address devices solely intended for use in animals.

considerations).3  This draft guidance presents considerations to illustrate FDA’s thinking on 
30 
factors that are relevant to the communication of benefit and risk information on Internet/social 
31 
media platforms with character space limitations.4 
32 
 
33 
Please note that this draft guidance does not address promotion via product websites, webpages on 
34 
social media networking platforms (e.g., individual product pages on websites such as Facebook, 
35 
Twitter, YouTube), and online web banners, as the Agency believes that these specific types of 
36 
Internet/social media platforms do not impose the same character space constraints as online 
37 
microblog messaging and online paid search.  This draft guidance also does not address responsive 
38 
web design or other technology-specific layout features that may result in product promotion 
39 
presentations that differ depending on the technology used to view them (e.g., desktop computer 
40 
monitors, mobile devices, tablets). 
41 
 
42 
FDA’s guidance documents, including this draft guidance, do not establish legally enforceable 
43 
rights or responsibilities.  Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and 
44 
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements 
45 
are cited.  The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or 
46 
recommended, but not required. 
47 
 
48 
II. 
BACKGROUND 
49 
 
50 
Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), the Agency has responsibility for 
51 
regulating the manufacture, sale, and distribution of drugs and medical devices in the United 
52 
States.  This authority includes oversight of the labeling of drugs and medical devices (21 U.S.C. 
53 
352(a)) and the advertising of prescription drugs and restricted medical devices (21 U.S.C. 352(n), 
54 
(q), and (r)).5 
55 
 
56 
Section 201(m) of the FD&C Act defines labeling as “all labels and other written, printed, or 
57 
graphic matter (1) upon any article or any of its containers or wrappers, or (2) accompanying such 
58 
article” (21 U.S.C. 321(m)).6  The U.S. Supreme Court has explained that the language 
59 
“accompanying such article” in the “labeling” definition is interpreted broadly, to include materials 
60 
that supplement or explain an article.  No physical attachment between the materials and the article 
61 
is necessary; rather, it is the textual relationship between the items that is significant (Kordel v. 
62 
                                                 
3 While online microblog messaging and online paid search examples are specifically illustrated within this draft 
guidance, FDA’s recommendations may also apply to advertising and promotional labeling on other types of 
Internet/social media platforms with character space limitations. 
4 This guidance document focuses on use of character-space-limited platforms by firms to make claims about their 
legally marketed drugs and devices that are consistent with their approved or required labeling.  Representations by a 
firm in character-space-limited platforms may also provide evidence of the intended use of the product, but that issue 
is not the focus of this draft guidance. 
5 Devices may become restricted by regulation issued under section 520(e) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360j(e)), by 
performance standard issued pursuant to section 514(a)(2)(B)(v) (21 U.S.C. 360d(a)(2)(B)(v)), or by order approving 
an application for premarket approval (i.e., a PMA) pursuant to section 515(d)(1)(B)(ii) (21 U.S.C. 360e(d)(1)(B)(ii)). 
6 See also 21 CFR 1.3(a).

United States, 335 U.S. 345, 350 (1948)).  FDA generally recognizes two types of labeling:  (1) 
63 
FDA-required labeling7 and (2) promotional labeling.  Promotional labeling is generally any 
64 
labeling, other than the FDA-required labeling, that is devised for promotion of the product.  
65 
Examples of materials that may be considered promotional labeling pieces for prescription drugs 
66 
are described in 21 CFR 202.1(l)(2).  The scope of labeling for prescription medical devices is 
67 
described in 21 CFR 801.109. 
68 
 
69 
The FD&C Act does not define what constitutes an “advertisement,” but FDA regulations provide 
70 
several examples, including “advertisements in published journals, magazines, other periodicals, 
71 
and newspapers, and advertisements broadcast through media such as radio, television, and 
72 
telephone communication systems” (21 CFR 202.1(l)(1)). 
73 
 
74 
Under the FD&C Act and FDA's implementing regulations, promotional labeling for drugs and 
75 
devices and advertisements for prescription drugs and restricted devices misbrand the product if 
76 
they make representations about the use of a firm’s product without disclosing certain information 
77 
about the product’s risk (FD&C Act sections 502(a)(n)(q)(r), 201(n); 21 CFR 1.21(a); 21 CFR 
78 
201.1).  When using Internet/social media platforms with character space limitations for product 
79 
promotion, firms should consider the following provisions8: 
80 
 
81 
• Any promotional labeling for a drug or device must be truthful and non-misleading (FD&C 
82 
Act sections 502(a), 201(n)). 
83 
 
84 
• Any promotional labeling that makes claims about a firm’s prescription drug or prescription 
85 
device must include certain information, such as the indicated use of the product and the risks 
86 
associated with use of the product (21 CFR 201.100(d), 201.105(d) and 801.109(d)). 
87 
 
88 
• Pursuant to section 502(c) for drugs and devices, information required to appear on the label or 
89 
labeling must be placed prominently thereon with such conspicuousness and in such terms as 
90 
to render it likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under customary 
91 
conditions of purchase and use. 
92 
 
93 
                                                 
7 Much FDA-required labeling is subject to FDA review and approval.  For example, after drafting by the 
manufacturer, labeling is reviewed and approved by FDA as part of the new drug application (NDA), new animal drug 
application (NADA), biologics license application (BLA) or premarket approval application (PMA) review (see 21 
CFR 314.50(c)(2), 514.1(b)(3), 601.2(a), 814.20(b)(10) and 814.44(d)).  For devices that are subject to premarket 
notification (510(k)) requirements, the 510(k) must contain the proposed labeling sufficient to describe the device, its 
intended use, and the directions for its use (21 CFR 807.87(e)).  All devices, including those exempt from premarket 
review, are subject to the requirements of applicable labeling regulations, including requirements for adequate 
directions for use (see 21 CFR Part 801).  For a prescription drug or prescription device to be exempted from the 
FD&C Act’s requirement of adequate directions for use (21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)), its FDA-required labeling must contain, 
among other information, information addressing product hazards and other risk information, as specified in FDA 
regulations (21 CFR 201.100(d)(1), (3), 201.105(c)(1), and 801.109). 
8 This is not an exhaustive list.

• Any advertising that makes representations about the use of a firm’s prescription drug must 
94 
include certain risk information (FD&C Act section 502(n); 21 CFR 202.1).9  Similarly, 
95 
section 502(r) of the FD&C Act requires a “brief statement of intended uses” and relevant risk 
96 
information in restricted-device advertising.  Section 502(q) of the FD&C Act provides that 
97 
restricted-device advertising that “is false or misleading in any particular” misbrands the 
98 
device.  Note that “reminder” promotion, which calls attention to the name of a product but 
99 
does not make any representations or suggestions about the product, is exempt from many of 
100 
these labeling and advertising disclosure requirements (21 CFR 200.200, 201.100(f), 
101 
201.105(d)(2), 202.1(e)(2)(i), 801.109(d)).10 
102 
 
103 
• Prescription drug advertisements must present a fair balance between information relating to 
104 
risk and information relating to benefit (21 CFR 202.1(e)(5)(ii)).  In addition, risk information 
105 
must be presented with a prominence and readability reasonably comparable to claims about 
106 
drug benefits (21 CFR 202.1(e)(7)(viii)). 
107 
 
108 
• Furthermore, for prescription drug advertisements to be truthful and non-misleading, they must 
109 
contain risk information in each part, as necessary, to qualify any representations and/or 
110 
suggestions made in that part about the drug.  The risk information may be concise if 
111 
supplemented by a prominent reference to the presence and location elsewhere in the 
112 
advertisement of a more complete discussion (21 CFR 202.1(e)(3)(i)). 
113 
 
114 
• In addition, section 201(n) of the FD&C Act provides that in determining whether a drug or 
115 
device is misbranded because its labeling or advertising is misleading, it must be considered 
116 
whether the labeling or advertising fails to reveal facts that are material with respect to possible 
117 
consequences of the use of the product as represented in the labeling or advertising or under 
118 
conditions of use that are customary or usual. 
119 
 
120 
Risk information should be comparable in content and prominence to benefit claims within the 
121 
product promotion (i.e., a balanced presentation).  Achieving a balanced presentation requires 
122 
firms to carefully consider the desired benefit claims and risk profiles for their products when 
123 
choosing a promotional platform.  FDA acknowledges that Internet/social media platforms 
124 
associated with character space limitations may pose challenges for firms in providing a balanced 
125 
presentation of both risks and benefits of medical products, as discussed above. 
126 
 
127 
                                                 
9 As set forth above, with regard to devices, the Agency’s authority over promotional labeling extends to all devices, 
whereas its authority over advertising extends to restricted devices.  Regardless of the type of device, FDA encourages 
firms to use the practices outlined in this guidance to benefit the public health. 
10 This draft guidance does not apply to those reminder promotions (labeling or advertising that calls attention to the 
name of a drug or device but does not include indications, dosage recommendations, or other information) that are 
exempted by regulation from the requirements under the FD&C Act for the disclosure of risk information.  See 21 
CFR 200.200, 201.100(f), 201.105(d)(2), 202.1(e)(2)(i), 801.109(d).  But see 21 U.S.C. 352(r) (requiring certain risk 
information in all restricted-device advertisements).

5 
FDA is issuing this draft guidance to aid firms in effectively communicating benefit and risk 
128 
information in product promotion using character-space-limited platforms such as online 
129 
microblog messaging and online paid search.11  However, regardless of the platform, truthful, 
130 
accurate, non-misleading, and balanced product promotion best serves the public health.  For some 
131 
products, particularly those with complex indications or extensive serious risks, character space 
132 
limitations imposed by platform providers may not enable meaningful presentations of both benefit 
133 
and risk (although they may be sufficient for “reminder” promotions—see footnote 10).  If an 
134 
accurate and balanced presentation of both risks and benefits of a specific product is not possible 
135 
within the constraints of the platform, then the firm should reconsider using that platform for the 
136 
intended promotional message (other than for permitted reminder promotion). 
137 
 
138 
III. 
OVERVIEW OF FDA’S POLICY ON PRESENTING RISK AND BENEFIT 
139 
INFORMATION ON INTERNET/SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS WITH 
140 
CHARACTER SPACE LIMITATIONS 
141 
 
142 
Regardless of character space constraints that may be present on certain Internet/social media 
143 
platforms, if a firm chooses to make a product benefit claim, the firm should also incorporate risk 
144 
information within the same character-space-limited communication.  The firm should also 
145 
provide a mechanism to allow direct access to a more complete discussion of the risks associated 
146 
with its product. 
147 
 
148 
Section IV discusses general factors that firms should consider in the communication of benefit 
149 
information on Internet/social media platforms with character space limitations, which directly 
150 
impacts the communication of risk information.  Section V explains in detail the factors that FDA 
151 
considers in the disclosure of risk information on Internet/social media platforms with character 
152 
space limitations.  Section VI provides firms with additional recommendations for the inclusion of 
153 
other product information (including certain required product information other than risk/benefit 
154 
information, as applicable) on Internet/social media platforms with character space limitations. 
155 
 
156 
Please note that sections IV, V, and VI provide hypothetical examples12 that, when taken in 
157 
totality, illustrate FDA’s recommendations for how firms may disseminate product promotion on 
158 
Internet/social media platforms with character space limitations.  The examples build on the 
159 
considerations set forth from the previous section and are numbered accordingly to identify related 
160 
examples (e.g., examples 1A, 1B, and 1C are related to the same hypothetical product—example 
161 
1A incorporates benefit information, example 1B adds risk information to example 1A, and 
162 
example 1C provides additional recommendations for examples 1A and 1B to illustrate, in totality, 
163 
                                                 
11 CDER’s OPDP, formerly known as the Division of Drug Marketing, Advertising, and Communications (DDMAC), 
issued 14 enforcement letters involving sponsored link promotion on Apr 2, 2009 (see FDA’s enforcement website 
available at 
http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/EnforcementActivitiesbyFDA/WarningLetters
andNoticeofViolationLetterstoPharmaceuticalCompanies/ucm055773.htm).

a final example of promotion on an Internet/social media platform with character space limitations 
164 
to which the Agency would not intend to object). 
165 
 
166 
FDA recommends that firms first carefully consider the complexity of the indication and risk 
167 
profiles for each of their products to determine whether a character-space-limited platform is a 
168 
viable promotional tool for a particular product, and then take the factors, recommendations, and 
169 
hypothetical examples outlined in this guidance document into account when developing benefit 
170 
and risk presentations.  The public health is best served when risk and effectiveness information 
171 
about drug and device products is clearly and accurately communicated. 
172 
 
173 
IV. 
GENERAL FACTORS CONSIDERED IN THE COMMUNICATION OF BENEFIT 
174 
INFORMATION ON INTERNET/SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS WITH 
175 
CHARACTER SPACE LIMITATIONS 
176 
 
177 
When the Agency evaluates advertising and promotional labeling for compliance with the FD&C 
178 
Act and FDA’s implementing regulations, it determines whether claims about both the benefits and 
179 
risks of the product are accurate and non-misleading.  The Agency also looks at whether benefits 
180 
and risks are presented in a comparably prominent manner (as outlined above in section II).  Thus, 
181 
considerations involving the content and format of benefit information are an inherent part of 
182 
FDA’s evaluation of risk presentations on Internet/social media platforms. 
183 
 
184 
In communicating benefit information on Internet/social media platforms with character space 
185 
limitations, firms should consider the following points: 
186 
 
187 
1. Benefit information should be accurate and non-misleading and reveal material facts within 
188 
each individual character-space-limited communication (e.g., each individual message or 
189 
tweet). 
190 
 
191 
When communicating benefit information about its product, a firm should ensure that benefit 
192 
information is accurate and non-misleading.  In doing so, the firm should also reveal material facts 
193 
about the use of its product, such as limitations to an indication or the relevant patient population. 
194 
For example, a firm should refer to the “Indications and Usage” portion of the Highlights of 
195 
Prescribing Information that is available for many human prescription drugs to help determine 
196 
what information to convey, although the firm is generally not required to use the precise wording 
197 
found there.  Labeling for an approved premarket approval application (PMA) for class III medical 
198 
devices or use information consistent with a cleared intended use for 510(k) medical devices 
199 
provides the basis for the benefit information related to devices.  Such information would include 
200 
material facts that the firm should present within the individual character-space-limited 
201 
communication because, without doing so, the benefit information in totality may be misleading. 
202 
 
203 
2. Benefit information should be accompanied by risk information within each individual 
204 
character-space-limited communication. 
205 
 
206

Draft – Not for Implementation  
 
 
7 
A firm should also consider whether, once benefit information is conveyed in an accurate and non-
207 
misleading manner, enough capacity will remain in the character-space-limited communication to 
208 
adequately convey required risk information.  Please refer to section V for factors firms should 
209 
consider in the disclosure of risk information.  In addition, a firm should consider whether enough 
210 
capacity will remain in the character-space-limited communication to adequately convey certain 
211 
other required information, as applicable.  Please refer to section VI for additional 
212 
recommendations firms should consider for the inclusion of other product information. 
213 
 
214 
3. If a firm concludes that adequate benefit and risk information, as well as other required 
215 
information, cannot all be communicated within the same character-space-limited 
216 
communication, then the firm should reconsider using that platform for the intended 
217 
promotional message. 
218 
 
219 
Example 1A:  A firm is considering promotion of its prescription drug NoFocus on Twitter, which 
220 
is limited to 140 character spaces per message or tweet.  NoFocus is indicated for mild to moderate 
221 
memory loss.  Any benefit information that the firm communicates about NoFocus should be 
222 
accurate and non-misleading and include material facts about the use of NoFocus, i.e., that it is 
223 
indicated for mild to moderate memory loss. 
224 
 
225 
The firm considers including the following benefit information within the tweet [the information in 
226 
brackets denotes character spaces used/140 available character spaces in a tweet]: 
227 
 
228 
NoFocus for mild to moderate memory loss [40/140] 
229 
 
230 
The benefit information for NoFocus that is communicated within the first 40 character spaces of 
231 
this tweet is accurate and non-misleading and includes material facts about the indication and 
232 
limitations to the use of NoFocus.  The firm should consider whether the remaining 100 character 
233 
spaces are enough to include risk information and certain other required information, as applicable, 
234 
about NoFocus.  See examples 1B and 1C in sections V and VI in this draft guidance, respectively, 
235 
for further considerations on the disclosure of risk and other information for NoFocus within this 
236 
tweet.  If the firm concludes that adequate benefit and risk information, as well as other required 
237 
information, cannot all be communicated within the same tweet, then the firm should reconsider 
238 
using Twitter for the intended promotional message for NoFocus. 
239 
 
240 
Example 2A:  A firm is considering promotion of its prescription drug Headhurtz using Google’s 
241 
Sitelink extensions (sponsored link promotion that contains character space limitations and specific 
242 
formatting requirements, sometimes referred to in this guidance document as “Sitelinks”).13  
243 
Headhurtz is indicated for severe headache associated with traumatic brain injury.  Any benefit 
244 
information that the firm communicates about Headhurtz should be accurate and non-misleading 
245 
                                                 
13 The example featured in this guidance relies on one specific Google formatting option (current as of Jan 22, 2014); 
however, it may be possible to follow the concepts outlined in this draft guidance for other types of sponsored link 
promotion or Internet/social media platforms with character space limitations.

8 
and include material facts about the use of Headhurtz, i.e., that it is indicated for severe headache 
246 
associated with traumatic brain injury. 
247 
 
248 
The firm considers including the following benefit information within the sponsored link 
249 
promotion [the information in brackets denotes character spaces used/available character spaces 
250 
per line of the sponsored link promotion]:   
251 
 
252 
Headhurtz [9/25] 
253 
 
www.headhurtz.com [17/35] 
254 
For severe headache from traumatic brain injury [47/70] 
255 
 
256 
The benefit information for Headhurtz that is communicated within the character spaces for this 
257 
specific sponsored link format is accurate and non-misleading and includes material facts about the 
258 
indication and limitations to the use of, and the specific patient population for, Headhurtz.  The 
259 
firm should consider whether risk information and certain other required information, as 
260 
applicable, about Headhurtz can also be included within the remaining character spaces for this 
261 
specific sponsored link format.  See examples 2B and 2C in sections V and VI in this draft 
262 
guidance, respectively, for further considerations on the disclosure of risk and other information 
263 
for Headhurtz within this sponsored link format.  If the firm concludes that adequate benefit and 
264 
risk information, as well as other required information, cannot all be communicated within this 
265 
same sponsored link format, then the firm should reconsider using Google’s Sitelinks for the 
266 
intended promotional message for Headhurtz.

V. 
FACTORS CONSIDERED IN THE DISCLOSURE OF RISK INFORMATION ON 
269 
INTERNET/SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS WITH CHARACTER SPACE 
270 
LIMITATIONS 
271 
 
272 
This section of the draft guidance outlines factors considered in the disclosure of risk information 
273 
on Internet/social media platforms with character space limitations.  As previously stated, 
274 
regardless of character space constraints that may be present on certain Internet/social media 
275 
platforms, if a firm chooses to make a product benefit claim, the firm should also incorporate risk 
276 
information within the same character-space-limited communication.  The firm should also 
277 
provide a mechanism to allow direct access to a more complete discussion of the risks associated 
278 
with its product. 
279 
 
280 
In general, the Agency considers two primary factors to determine whether risk information is 
281 
comparable in scope to benefit information within promotional materials: (1) whether the risk 
282 
information qualifies any representations made about the product (i.e., content of the risk 
283 
information compared to content of the benefit information) and (2) whether the risk information is 
284 
presented with a prominence and readability comparable to the benefit claims about the product.14 
285 
                                                 
14 FDA has developed separate draft guidance that, when final, will represent the Agency’s current thinking on how 
firms should, in general, present risk information in other types of promotional materials. See the draft guidance for

286 
However, the Agency is aware of the challenges in balancing benefit and risk information within 
287 
the character space constraints of certain Internet/social media platforms—particularly in terms of 
288 
content—because of the sheer volume of information.  The Agency believes that a concise 
289 
disclosure of specific risk information may be presented together with benefit information within 
290 
the confines of character-space-limited Internet/social media platforms if supplemented by a 
291 
prominent reference to the presence and location elsewhere of a more complete discussion of the 
292 
risks associated with the product (or for restricted-device advertising, a “brief statement” of 
293 
intended use and relevant risk information) and that this is consistent with requirements of the 
294 
FD&C Act and FDA’s implementing regulations (see section II).  These concepts are further 
295 
elucidated below in this section of the guidance document. 
296 
 
297 
In communicating risk information on Internet/social media platforms with character space 
298 
limitations, firms should consider the following points: 
299 
 
300 
1. Risk information should be presented together with benefit information within each individual 
301 
character-space-limited communication (e.g., each individual message or tweet). 
302 
 
303 
2. The content of risk information presented within each individual character-space-limited 
304 
communication should, at a minimum, include the most serious risks associated with the 
305 
product. 
306 
 
307 
At a minimum, a firm should communicate the most serious risks associated with the product 
308 
together with the benefit information within the individual character-space-limited communication.  
309 
For a prescription human drug, the most serious risks would generally include all risk concepts 
310 
from a boxed warning, all risks that are known to be fatal or life-threatening, and all 
311 
contraindications15 from the approved product labeling (the PI).  If a prescription human drug does 
312 
not have a boxed warning, fatal or life-threatening risks, or any contraindications, the most 
313 
significant warnings or precautions about the product should be communicated.  For animal drugs, 
314 
the most serious risks would include potential injury to human handlers/animal patients and risk of 
315 
drug residues entering the human food chain.  For devices, if a particular risk is associated with a 
316 
particular identifiable use or population, then each of those should be included.  The Agency 
317 
believes that communication of the most serious risks as outlined above would provide a concise 
318 
statement of risk information about the product for promotion on Internet/social media platforms 
319 
with character space limitations. 
320 
 
321 
                                                                                                                                                                
industry entitled Presenting Risk Information in Prescription Drug and Medical Device Promotion available at 
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM155480.pdf. 
15 For prescription human drugs, if the only contraindication listed in the PI is hypersensitivity, the Agency would not 
expect that contraindication to be included as part of the risk disclosure within the character-space-limited 
communication unless there were documented cases of hypersensitivity occurring in patients who took the product.

3. A mechanism, such as a hyperlink, should also be provided within each individual character-
322 
space-limited communication to allow direct access to a more complete discussion of risk 
323 
information about the product. 
324 
 
325 
In addition to presenting the most serious risks within the individual character-space limited 
326 
communication, FDA recommends that a firm also include in that communication a direct 
327 
hyperlink to a destination (e.g., landing page) that is devoted exclusively to the communication of 
328 
risk information about the product.  Examples of such landing pages providing direct and exclusive 
329 
access to risk information could include a website devoted to providing comprehensive risk 
330 
information about the product, a particular webpage within a website that is devoted to providing 
331 
comprehensive risk information about the product, or a portable document format (PDF) file that is 
332 
devoted to providing comprehensive risk information about the product.  An example that the 
333 
Agency would not consider to provide direct and exclusive access to risk information would 
334 
include a hyperlink only to a product’s home page that also includes benefit information and other 
335 
claims or graphics.  Firms may include supplemental hyperlinks (e.g., to a product home page, to a 
336 
PI, or to a brief summary) either within the character-space-limited communication itself or on the 
337 
landing page of risk information, but the Agency recommends that a direct hyperlink to a landing 
338 
page that is devoted exclusively to comprehensive risk information about the product be initially 
339 
included within the original character-space-limited communication.16 
340 
 
341 
Many Internet/social media platforms allow the use of uniform resource locator (URL) shortening 
342 
services, which are likely to result in a URL or web address with fewer character spaces.  The 
343 
Agency does not intend to object to the use of such URL shortening services; however, when 
344 
possible, the Agency recommends that the URL or web address itself denote to the user that the 
345 
landing page consists of risk information (e.g., www.product.com/risk).  Please note that if the 
346 
URL or web address itself is promotional in content or tone, FDA may take into consideration 
347 
whether any resulting claims are false or misleading or provide evidence in support of other 
348 
violations under the FD&C Act and FDA’s implementing regulations (e.g., a URL such as 
349 
www.bestcancercuredrug.com may be misleading). 
350 
 
351 
4. The prominence of risk information should be comparable to the benefit information within 
352 
each individual character-space-limited communication, taking into consideration any 
353 
formatting capabilities available on the specific Internet/social media platform.  
354 
 
355 
If a firm uses techniques to emphasize benefit information within the character-space-limited 
356 
communication, the firm should consider similar techniques to achieve comparable emphasis of 
357 
                                                 
16 A firm should consider how to fulfill other regulatory requirements for advertising or promotional labeling as 
applicable, such as providing an accompanying brief summary or PI with promotion for a drug (see 202.1(e)(1) and 
201.100(d)).  Where such requirements apply, the Agency expects that a firm would provide access to a brief summary 
or PI to accompany the communication in the character-space-limited Internet/social media platform, for example, by 
providing a direct hyperlink to those materials either within the character-space-limited communication itself or on the 
landing page of risk information.  However, note that a link to a brief summary or PI should not be used in place of 
disclosing risk information within the original character-space-limited communication.

11 
risk information for its product.17  Additionally, FDA recommends that, where the platform 
358 
enables the use of different formatting, a firm utilize those formatting capabilities to highlight 
359 
significant risk information, such as a boxed warning (e.g., a firm should present the boxed 
360 
warning in bolded text to convey the seriousness of that particular risk for its product).   
361 
 
362 
Example 1B (continued from example 1A):  A firm is considering promotion of its prescription 
363 
drug NoFocus on Twitter, which is limited to 140 character spaces per message or tweet.  NoFocus 
364 
is indicated for mild to moderate memory loss.  There are no boxed or other warnings and no 
365 
known fatal or life-threatening risks included in the PI for NoFocus.  The most serious precaution 
366 
associated with NoFocus is that it may cause seizures in patients with a seizure disorder.  Since 
367 
benefit information was provided within the tweet (example 1A), the firm should communicate, at 
368 
a minimum, the most serious risks associated with NoFocus within the same tweet.  The firm 
369 
should also include within the same tweet a direct hyperlink to a more complete discussion of risk 
370 
information about NoFocus.  Additionally, the prominence of risk information should be 
371 
comparable to the benefit information contained within the tweet, taking into consideration any 
372 
formatting capabilities that may be available. 
373 
 
374 
The firm considers including the following benefit and risk information within the tweet: 
375 
 
376 
NoFocus for mild to moderate memory loss; may cause seizures in patients with a seizure 
377 
disorder www.nofocus.com/risk [117/140] 
378 
 
379 
In the above example, benefit information for NoFocus is accurate and non-misleading, and the 
380 
most serious risks associated with NoFocus are communicated together with the benefit 
381 
information within the tweet.  The firm includes a direct hyperlink to the “Important Safety 
382 
Information” webpage (within the product website) that is devoted to providing comprehensive 
383 
risk information about NoFocus.  In addition, the URL www.nofocus.com/risk (emphasis added) 
384 
denotes that the landing page is comprised of risk information, and the URL is not promotional in 
385 
tone.  The firm conveys risk information within the tweet in a comparable manner to the benefit 
386 
information.  See example 1C in section VI in this draft guidance for further considerations on the 
387 
inclusion of other product information for NoFocus within this tweet. 
388 
 
389 
Example 2B (continued from example 2A):  A firm is considering promotion of its prescription 
390 
drug Headhurtz using Google’s Sitelinks.18  Headhurtz is indicated for severe headache associated 
391 
                                                 
17 FDA acknowledges that providers of character-space-limited platforms frequently dictate aspects controlling the 
presentation of text that affect prominence and readability (e.g., font size and style).  Where the platform provider only 
permits one type of text, issues affecting comparability are less likely to arise. 
18 Google’s “Sitelink extensions” format allows up to six additional links (Sitelinks) to be shown in addition to the 
display URL (www.headhurtz.com in this example).  Under parameters set by Google, the link text for each of the 
Sitelinks must be 25 characters or fewer.  The link text must directly relate to the content on the landing page for that 
link and point to different content, i.e., no Sitelinks may lead to the same landing page or to the same content.  In 
addition, Sitelinks may not direct to the same landing page as the destination URL (the landing page for 
www.headhurtz.com in this example).  Furthermore, up to two optional description lines (35 characters or fewer per 
line) may be created for display underneath each of the Sitelinks.  This information is current as of Jan 22, 2014;

12 
with traumatic brain injury.  The PI for Headhurtz includes a boxed warning about the potential for 
392 
brain swelling and warnings about a potentially fatal drug reaction and a drop in heart rate that 
393 
may be life-threatening.  Since benefit information was provided within the sponsored link format 
394 
(example 2A), the firm should communicate, at a minimum, the most serious risks associated with 
395 
Headhurtz within the same sponsored link format.  The firm should also include within the same 
396 
sponsored link format a direct hyperlink to a more complete discussion of risk information about 
397 
Headhurtz.  Additionally, the prominence of the risk information should be comparable to the 
398 
benefit information contained within the sponsored link format, taking into consideration any 
399 
formatting capabilities that may be available. 
400 
 
401 
The firm considers including the following benefit and risk information within the sponsored link 
402 
promotion: 
403 
 
404 
Headhurtz [9/25] 
405 
 
www.headhurtz.com [17/ 35] 
406 
For severe headache from traumatic brain injury [47/ 70] 
407 
Boxed warning [13/25]  
 
 
Warning [7/25] 
408 
Potential for brain swelling [28/35] 
 
Potentially fatal drug reaction [31/35] 
409 
Warning [7/25]  
 
 
 
Risk information [16/25] 
410 
Life-threatening drop in heart rate [35/35] 
Important safety information [28/35] 
411 
 
412 
In the above example, benefit information for Headhurtz is accurate and non-misleading.  
413 
Consistent with the Google-imposed formatting requirements outlined in footnote 18, the firm 
414 
chooses to utilize three of the six Sitelinks to convey the most serious risks associated with 
415 
Headhurtz, including the boxed warning and additional warnings about fatal and life-threatening 
416 
risks.  Therefore, the most serious risks associated with Headhurtz are communicated together with 
417 
the benefit information within the sponsored link format.  The firm also includes a fourth Sitelink 
418 
that provides direct access to a more complete discussion of risk information about Headhurtz.  
419 
Furthermore, consistent with the Google-imposed link requirements outlined in footnote 18, the 
420 
firm creates four different landing pages, each with different content.  The first Sitelink is a direct 
421 
hyperlink to a webpage that is devoted to providing detailed information about the boxed warning 
422 
on the potential for brain swelling.  The second and third Sitelinks are direct hyperlinks to 
423 
webpages that are each devoted to a discussion of the specific warning conveyed within the 
424 
descriptions under these Sitelinks (i.e., a potentially fatal drug reaction and a life-threatening drop 
425 
in heart rate).  The fourth Sitelink is a direct hyperlink to the “Important Safety Information” 
426 
webpage (within the product website) that is devoted to providing comprehensive risk information 
427 
about Headhurtz.  The firm conveys risk information within the sponsored link format in a 
428 
comparable manner to the benefit information.  See example 2C in section VI in this draft 
429 
guidance for further considerations on the inclusion of other product information for Headhurtz 
430 
within this sponsored link format. 
431

VI. 
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE INCLUSION OF OTHER PRODUCT 
433 
INFORMATION ON INTERNET/SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS WITH 
434 
CHARACTER SPACE LIMITATIONS 
435 
 
436 
This section of the draft guidance provides additional recommendations regarding the inclusion of 
437 
other product information (including certain required product information other than risk/benefit 
438 
information, as applicable) on Internet/social media platforms with character space limitations.  In 
439 
addition to including both benefit and risk information within a character-space-limited 
440 
communication, there may be other applicable legal requirements to consider. 
441 
 
442 
In communicating product information on Internet/social media platforms associated with 
443 
character space limitations, firms should consider the following: 
444 
 
445 
• Sections 502(e), (n), and (r) of the FD&C Act (21 USC 352(e), (n), and (r)) require that the 
446 
established name accompany the trade or brand name in labeling and in prescription drug and 
447 
restricted-device advertising.  Drug regulations specifically require that the established name 
448 
be in direct conjunction with the proprietary name or designation (21 CFR 201.10(g)(1) and 
449 
202.1(b)(1)).19 
450 
 
451 
• The drug regulations also stipulate that advertisements shall prominently display the name of at 
452 
least one specific dosage form and have the quantitative ingredient information required by 
453 
section 502(n) of the FD&C Act in direct conjunction with such display.  If other dosage forms 
454 
are listed in the advertisement, the quantitative ingredient information for such dosage forms 
455 
shall appear in direct conjunction and in equal prominence with the most prominent listing of 
456 
the names of such dosage forms (21 CFR 202.1(d)(2)). 
457 
 
458 
With regard to the above regulatory provisions when using Internet/social media platforms with 
459 
character space limitations, the Agency does not intend to object where the following approaches 
460 
are used: 
461 
 
462 
• Firms should communicate both the proprietary (trade or brand) name and established name 
463 
(for drugs, often referred to as the generic name) within the character-space-limited 
464 
communication.  The generic name of the product should be listed directly to the right of, or 
465 
directly below, the brand name. 
466 
 
467 
• On the landing page associated with each hyperlink provided in the character-space-limited 
468 
communication, firms should again communicate both the brand and established names as 
469 
recommended in the preceding bullet.  In addition, for prescription drugs, firms should 
470 
                                                 
19 FDA has developed separate guidance that addresses product name placement and size in promotion.  See the draft 
guidance Product Name Placement, Size, and Prominence in Advertising and Promotional Labeling available at 
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm070076.pdf.

14 
prominently display at least one dosage form and quantitative ingredient information in direct 
471 
conjunction with the brand and established names. 
472 
 
473 
In addition, the Agency believes that common abbreviations (including scientific and medical 
474 
abbreviations), punctuations marks, and other symbols may, in many cases, reasonably be used to 
475 
help address character space constraints.  The following examples illustrate instances where the 
476 
Agency does not intend to object to such usage: 
477 
 
478 
• Commonly recognized linguistic symbols may be substituted for words.  For example, the 
479 
ampersand symbol (&) may be used in place of the word and. 
480 
 
481 
• Punctuation marks may be used to help with the presentation of information.  For example, 
482 
dashes may be used to help separate benefit and risk information.

Example 1C (continued from example 1B):  A firm is considering promotion of its prescription 
488 
drug NoFocus on Twitter, which is limited to 140 character spaces per message or tweet.  NoFocus 
489 
is indicated for mild to moderate memory loss.  There are no boxed or other warnings and no 
490 
known fatal or life-threatening risks included in the PI for NoFocus.  The most serious precaution 
491 
associated with NoFocus is that it may cause seizures in patients with a seizure disorder.  The 
492 
FDA-approved name is NoFocus (rememberine hydrochloride) Capsules, and NoFocus is 
493 
available as 200mg capsules.  In addition to taking into consideration factors for communicating 
494 
benefit and risk information within the character-space-limited communication as described in 
495 
sections IV and V, the firm should also communicate the brand and established names within the

In the above example, the brand and established names are communicated together within the 
505 
tweet.  Note that the firm uses the abbreviation HCl in place of hydrochloride within the 
506 
established name presentation.  The firm uses a dash with no additional spaces to separate the 
507 
benefit and risk information.  As specified in example 1B, the firm includes a direct hyperlink to 
508 
the “Important Safety Information” webpage (within the product website) that is devoted to 
509 
providing comprehensive risk information about NoFocus.  At the top of the landing page, the firm 
510
