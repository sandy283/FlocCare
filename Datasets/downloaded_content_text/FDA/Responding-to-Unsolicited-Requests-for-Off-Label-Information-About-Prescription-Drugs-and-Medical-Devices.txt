This draft guidance, when finalized, will represent the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) 
9 
current thinking on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does 
10 
not operate to bind FDA or the public.  You may use an alternative approach if the approach 
11 
satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.  If you want to discuss an 
12 
alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance.  If you 
13 
cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title pages of 
14 
this guidance.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
18 
19 
This draft guidance is intended to describe the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA or Agency) 
20 
current thinking about how manufacturers and distributors (firms) of prescription human and 
21 
animal drug products (drugs) and medical devices (devices) can respond to unsolicited requests for 
22 
information about unapproved or uncleared indications or conditions of use (off-label information) 
23 
related to their FDA-approved or cleared products.1,2  This draft guidance updates and clarifies 
24 
FDA’s policies on unsolicited requests for off-label information, including those that firms may 
25 
encounter through emerging electronic media. 
1 This draft guidance has been prepared by the Office of Prescription Drug Products (OPDP) in the Center for Drug 
Evaluation and Research (CDER) in consultation with the Center for Biologics Evaluation Research (CBER), the 
Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), and the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM).
2 The recommendations in this draft guidance also apply to biological products that are approved for marketing under 
section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act).  Because each biological product also meets the definition of 
“drug” or “device” under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), it is also subject to regulation under 
provisions of the FD&C Act applicable to drugs or devices, as well as the regulations implementing these provisions, 
except that a biological product licensed under section 351 of the PHS Act is not required to have an approved new 
drug application under section 505 of the FD&C Act. (See PHS Act section 351(j), 42 U.S.C. 262(j).) 
In addition, the term “approved or cleared product” in this draft guidance encompasses devices that are legally 
marketed for a specific intended use without an individual product approval or substantial equivalence determination 
(clearance). This includes class I and class II devices marketed for uses that make them exempt from premarket 
notification, in accordance with sections 510(l) or (m) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360(l) & (m)).  As a result, with 
regard to such products, a request for “off-label information” refers to any request for information regarding a new use 
for which approval or clearance would be required.  This draft guidance does not address devices solely intended for 
use in animals.

Draft – Not for Implementation 
26 
This draft guidance does not address requests for information about approved or cleared 
27 
indications or conditions of use (on-label information) for FDA-regulated medical products.  It 
28 
also does not address requests for information about medical products that are not currently 
29 
approved or cleared for any purpose. 
30 
31 
FDA’s guidance documents, including this draft guidance, do not establish legally enforceable 
32 
rights or responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and 
33 
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements 
34 
are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or 
35 
recommended, but not required.

II. 
BACKGROUND 
39 
40 
The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and FDA's implementing regulations 
41 
prohibit manufacturers and distributors (firms) from introducing new drugs, new animal drugs, and 
42 
most Class III medical devices into interstate commerce for any intended use that FDA has not 
43 
determined to be safe and effective.  The FD&C Act and FDA’s implementing regulations also 
44 
prohibit device firms subject to premarket notification requirements under section 510(k), which 
45 
includes most class II and some class I devices, from introducing such devices into interstate 
46 
47 
commerce for any intended use that is outside FDA’s substantial equivalence determination 
(clearance) for such devices.3  Statements that promote a drug or medical device for uses other 
48 
than those approved or cleared by FDA may be used as evidence of a new intended use.  
49 
Introducing a product into commerce for such a new intended use without FDA approval or 
50 
clearance would, under these requirements, generally violate the law.  However, once a drug or 
51 
medical device has been approved or cleared by FDA, generally, health care professionals can 
52 
53 
lawfully use or prescribe that product for uses or treatment indications that are not included in the 
product's approved labeling4 (or, in the case of a medical device cleared under the 510(k) process, 
54 
in the product's statement of intended uses).  FDA recognizes that these off-label uses or treatment 
55 
regimens may be important therapeutic options and may even constitute a medically recognized 
56 
standard of care. 
57 
58 
Scientific or medical departments within drug or medical device firms often maintain a large body 
59 
of information about their products.  This information typically includes data and other 
60 
information consistent with the approved or cleared indications or conditions of use for their 
61 
products, but may also include off-label information for their products.  As noted, although 
62 
dissemination of off-label information can be used as evidence of new intended uses for products 
63 
in distribution, such information may also be of use to individuals seeking information about a 
3 See e.g., sections 505(a), 501(a), 301(d), 501(f)(1)(B) and 502(o) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 355(a), 351(a), 
331(d), 351(f)(1)(B) and 352(o). 
4 See sections 512(a)(4) and (a)(5) of the FD&C Act and this Agency’s regulations at 21 CFR part 530 for specific 
provisions related to the off-label (or extra-label) use of approved animal and human drugs in animals.

64 
medical product for themselves, patients, family members, or friends.  These individuals 
65 
sometimes submit non-public requests for off-label information directly and privately to firms. 
66 
67 
The rapid growth of the Internet, including social media tools and other emerging technologies, 
68 
69 
has made it easier for both consumers and health care professionals to quickly seek information 
about medical conditions and treatments.5  Many firms have also used emerging electronic media 
70 
to disseminate product information.  As a result, firms may encounter requests for off-label 
71 
information about their products through product websites, discussion boards, chat rooms, or other 
72 
public electronic forums that they maintain and over which they have full control.  In addition, 
73 
third-party sites (i.e., websites and other venues that are either entirely independent of a firm’s 
74 
control and influence or not fully controlled by a firm) also may reveal questions about off-label 
75 
uses of a firm’s products.  These questions about off-label uses are typically directed to users of 
76 
the site at large, rather than directly and privately to firms.  Such posted information is likely to be 
77 
available to a much broader audience than just the original requester, especially because 
78 
communication threads (i.e., questions and replies) are often available for an indefinite period of 
79 
time. 
80 
81 
This draft guidance provides FDA’s recommendations to firms wishing to respond to unsolicited 
82 
requests for off-label information, including both requests made directly and privately to firms and 
83 
requests made in public forums, including through emerging electronic media.  FDA recognizes 
84 
that firms are capable of responding to requests about their own named products in a truthful, non­
85 
misleading, and accurate manner.  Furthermore, as these firms are regulated by FDA and have 
86 
robust and current information about their products, FDA recognizes that it can be in the best 
87 
interest of public health for a firm to respond to unsolicited requests for information about off-label 
88 
uses of the firm’s products that are addressed to a public forum, as other participants in the forum 
89 
who offer responses may not provide or have access to the most accurate and up-to-date 
90 
information about the firm’s products. 
91 
92 
If a firm responds to unsolicited requests for off-label information in the manner described in this 
93 
draft guidance, FDA does not intend to use such responses as evidence of the firm’s intent that the 
94 
product be used for an unapproved or uncleared use.  Such responses would also not be expected 
95 
to comply with the disclosure requirements related to promotional labeling and advertising.  Firms 
96 
may choose to respond to unsolicited requests for information about off-label uses of their 
97 
approved or cleared products in a manner other than that recommended in this draft guidance.  
98 
99 
Such activity would not constitute a per se violation of the law, but could potentially be introduced 
as evidence of a new intended use.6 
5 For example, the public is able to obtain information on certain clinical trial results from www.ClinicalTrials.gov. 
This may include information related to off-label uses.  This information may generate questions directly to a firm. 
6 This draft guidance is not intended to suggest that receiving an unsolicited request is the only circumstance in which 
a firm can disseminate information about unapproved uses of its FDA-regulated products without such dissemination 
being used as evidence of the firm’s intent that the product be used for an unapproved use.  For example, FDA has 
developed separate guidance that addresses manufacturer-initiated distribution of reprints regarding off-label uses.

III. 
DETERMINING WHETHER A REQUEST IS UNSOLICITED OR SOLICITED 
101 
102 
This draft guidance addresses how to respond to unsolicited requests for off-label information 
103 
about drugs and medical devices.  To illustrate the difference between unsolicited and solicited 
104 
requests, this section describes these two categories of requests and presents a number of examples 
105 
of both types of requests. 
106 
107 
A. 
Unsolicited Requests 
108 
109 
Unsolicited requests are those initiated by persons or entities that are completely independent of 
110 
the relevant firm.  (This may include many health care professionals, health care organizations, 
111 
members of the academic community, and formulary committees, as well as consumers such as 
112 
patients and caregivers).  Requests that are prompted in any way by a manufacturer or its 
113 
representatives are not unsolicited requests.  Two types of unsolicited requests are addressed in this 
114 
draft guidance: non-public unsolicited requests and public unsolicited requests.  Responses to 
115 
unsolicited requests can likewise be non-public (private) or public. 
116 
117 
 Non-public unsolicited requests 
118 
119 
A non-public unsolicited request is an unsolicited request that is directed privately to a firm using a 
120 
one-on-one communication approach. 
121 
122 
Example 1: An individual calls or e-mails the medical information staff at a firm seeking 
123 
information about an off-label use.  In this case, neither the request nor the response would be 
124 
visible to the public. 
125 
126 
 Public unsolicited requests 
127 
128 
A public unsolicited request is an unsolicited request made in a public forum, whether directed to a 
129 
firm specifically or to a forum at large. 
130 
131 
Example 2:  During a live presentation, an individual asks a question, directed to a firm’s 
132 
representative but heard by other attendees, regarding off-label use of a specific product.  This 
133 
request is a public request. Similarly, a response by the firm that is conveyed to the same audience 
134 
as the original question would be considered a public response. 
135 
136 
Example 3: An individual posts a question about off-label use of a specific product on a firm­
137 
controlled website (or a third-party discussion forum) that is visible to a broad audience.  The 
138 
request could be directed to a firm specifically or posed to users of a discussion forum at large.

Draft – Not for Implementation 
139 
This request is a public online request. Similarly, a response by the firm that is visible to the same 
140 
audience as the original question would be considered a public online response. 
141 
142 
B. 
Solicited Requests 
143 
144 
FDA considers requests for off-label information that are prompted in any way by a manufacturer 
145 
or its representatives to be solicited.  Such solicited requests may be considered evidence of a 
146 
firm’s intent that a drug or medical device be used for a use other than that specifically approved 
147 
148 
or cleared by FDA. Although not exhaustive, the following examples illustrate what FDA 
generally considers to be solicited requests for off-label information7: 
149 
150 
Example 4:  If a firm’s sales representative mentions a use of a product that is not reflected in the 
151 
product’s approved labeling and invites a health care professional to request more information, 
152 
resulting requests would be considered solicited requests. 
153 
154 
Example 5:  If a representative of a firm, such as a medical science liaison or paid speaker (e.g., 
155 
key opinion leader), presents off-label use data at a company-sponsored promotional event (e.g., a 
156 
dinner) and attendees then ask or submit requests for more information, these requests would be 
157 
considered solicited requests. 
158 
159 
Example 6:  If a firm issues to health care professionals business reply cards that are intended for 
160 
use in requesting off-label information, presents statements or contact information in promotional 
161 
pieces in a manner that solicits requests for off-label medical or scientific information (e.g., 
162 
“Product X continues to be evaluated in more than 50 trials in a broad range of conditions and 
163 
patients” and “Call 1-800-… for more information”), or displays a commercial exhibit panel 
164 
suggesting a new indication (e.g., a sign that reads “Coming Soon, a new use for Product X”), 
165 
requests made in response to these types of prompts would be considered solicited requests. 
166 
167 
Example 7:  If a firm provides a phone number, e-mail address, uniform resource locator (URL), or 
168 
username that is a word, alpha phrase, or alpha representation implying the availability of off-label 
169 
information for its product, requests using this phone number, e-mail address, URL, or username 
170 
would be considered solicited requests. 
171 
172 
Example 8:  A firm asks or otherwise encourages users to post videos about their own uses of its 
173 
product on third-party video-sharing sites (e.g., YouTube), which may result in video postings 
174 
about an off-label use of its product.  If the firm’s initial request for posting of videos results in any 
175 
questions about off-label uses, or if any off-label video posting made in response to the firm’s 
176 
encouragement of video postings results in questions about the product’s off-label use, these 
177 
questions would be considered solicited requests. 
7 The focus of this draft guidance is unsolicited requests for off-label information, not compliance with provisions of 
FDA’s advertising and labeling regulations for drugs. We note, however, that in some of the following examples, a 
firm’s activities that serve to solicit the requests for off-label information may themselves give rise to specific 
regulatory violations.

178 
Example 9:  If a firm sends out packets of information to known bloggers or online consumer 
179 
reviewers and encourages them to write about an off-label use of its product on third-party sites 
180 
and this then provokes a discussion about that off-label use, any requests inquiring about the 
181 
product’s off-label use as a result of these blogs, whether posted as comments to the third-party 
182 
site or directed to the firm, would be considered solicited requests. 
183 
184 
Example 10:  If a firm announces results of a study via a microblogging service (e.g., Twitter) and 
185 
suggests that an off-label use of its product is safe and effective, any comments and requests 
186 
received as a result of the original message about the off-label use would be considered solicited 
187 
requests. 
188 
189 
Example 11:  If a firm sets up a website that enables viewers to read prepared standard responses 
190 
for the firm’s products that are generated from prefixed pull-down menus naming various disease 
191 
states, including any standard responses related to off-label uses for the firm’s product, resulting 
192 
requests for off-label information would be considered solicited.  Moreover, if this website makes 
193 
it possible to use search terms to generate standard responses that go beyond the scope of the 
194 
product information being requested, including off-label use information, resulting requests for and 
195 
responses to such a search would be considered solicited requests.

IV. 
OVERVIEW OF FDA’S POLICY ON RESPONDING TO UNSOLICITED 
199 
REQUESTS FOR OFF-LABEL INFORMATION 
200 
201 
FDA has long taken the position that firms can respond to unsolicited requests for information 
202 
about FDA-regulated medical products by providing truthful, balanced, non-misleading, and non­
203 
promotional scientific or medical information that is responsive to the specific request, even if 
204 
responding to the request requires a firm to provide information on unapproved or uncleared 
205 
indications or conditions of use. If responses to unsolicited requests fall within these parameters, 
206 
FDA has not expected those responses to meet regulatory requirements for promotional labeling or 
207 
advertising and has not considered these responses as evidence of intended use.  This draft 
208 
209 
guidance sets forth FDA’s current thinking on this topic, consistent with the Agency’s past policy 
statements about responding to unsolicited requests.8,9  Regardless of whether the initial 
8 This policy was articulated in a letter to industry in 1982 and has been restated on many occasions.  See Position on 
the Concept of Solicited and Unsolicited Requests (April 22, 1982) ("[T]he Division of Drug Advertising and Labeling 
will not regulate as labeling any and all unsolicited requests received from outside the company for information about 
a drug manufactured, distributed, or repacked by the company.  These types of legitimate requests from 
scientists/individuals for drug information will be regarded and treated as a personal communication between the 
requestor and firm."); 59 Fed. Reg. 59820, 59823 (November 18, 1994) (stating that manufacturers may respond to 
unsolicited requests for information with "responsive, nonpromotional, balanced scientific information, which may 
include information on unapproved uses, without subjecting their products to regulation based on the information"). 
FDA’s current views (expressed in this draft guidance) remain consistent with these past policy statements. 
9 In addition, section 557(a) of the FD&C Act, which expired on September 30, 2006, provided that "nothing in section 
551 [of the Act] shall be construed as prohibiting a manufacturer from disseminating information in response to an 
unsolicited request from a health care practitioner."  21 U.S.C.360aaa-6

RESPONDING TO NON-PUBLIC UNSOLICITED REQUESTS FOR OFF-LABEL 
222 
INFORMATION DIRECTED TO DRUG OR MEDICAL DEVICE FIRMS 
223 
224 
This section of the draft guidance makes recommendations about responding to non-public 
225 
unsolicited requests for off-label information about prescription human and animal drugs (drugs) 
226 
and medical devices (devices) specifically directed to firms privately through one-on-one 
227 
communications. For example, an individual might call or correspond directly with a firm 
228 
concerning the use of its product for an unapproved or uncleared indication or condition of use.  
229 
The firm could receive the request by mail, e-mail, telephone, or through a firm-controlled website 
230 
that enables individuals to privately submit a request directly to the firm so that the request is not 
231 
available to the public. 
232 
233 
FDA makes the following recommendations to a firm that is responding to a non-public 
234 
unsolicited request for off-label information about its product that was specifically directed to the 
235 
firm privately through a one-on-one communication. 
236 
237 
1. Information distributed in response to an unsolicited request should be provided only to the 
238 
individual making the request directly to the firm as a private, one-on-one communication. 
239 
240 
2. Information distributed in response to an unsolicited request should be tailored to answer only 
241 
the specific question(s) asked. 
242 
243 
A firm should ensure that all pertinent background data are obtained to be able to determine what 
244 
information is being requested before providing a response.  If an unsolicited question is broad in 
245 
nature, the firm should appropriately narrow the question.  In other words, the level of specificity 
246 
of the question posed is important to ensure that the firm’s response is tailored to the request. 
247 
248 
Example 12:  An individual requests information on the use of a drug or device for one particular 
249 
disease or condition that is considered off-label for that drug or device (e.g., use of Drug X during 
250 
pregnancy in patients with diabetes).  Generally, a firm should provide information pertaining only 
251 
to that disease or condition (i.e., the firm should provide a response tailored only to the use of Drug 
252 
X during pregnancy in patients with diabetes). 
7

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
Draft – Not for Implementation 
253 
However, if there is information about known or suspected risks associated with other diseases or 
254 
conditions that is also relevant to the disease or condition for which information was requested, the 
255 
firm should provide such information to ensure a complete and accurate presentation of the risk 
256 
issues associated with the requested use (e.g., Drug X is known to cause fetal harm when used in 
257 
pregnant patients with arthritis, and this risk information should be disclosed as part of the 
258 
response about use of Drug X during pregnancy in patients with diabetes). 
259 
260 
3. Information distributed in response to an unsolicited request should be truthful, non­
261 
misleading, accurate, and balanced.10 
262 
263 
A response should provide non-biased information or data relating to the particular off-label use 
264 
that is the subject of the request, including applicable data that are not supportive or that cast doubt 
265 
on the safety or efficacy of that use.  For example, when conclusions of articles or texts that are 
266 
disseminated have been specifically called into question by other articles or texts, a firm should 
267 
disseminate representative publications that reach contrary or different conclusions regarding the 
268 
use at issue. The response should include complete copies of scientific reprints, technical 
269 
literature, or other scientific and medical information responsive to the request, not just summary 
270 
documents or abstracts prepared by the firm.  The response can include unpublished data on file if 
271 
they are responsive to the specific request (either supporting or casting doubt on the safety or 
272 
efficacy of the off-label use). However, to the greatest extent possible, a firm should rely on 
273 
published peer-reviewed journal articles, medical texts, or data derived from independent sources.  
274 
To the extent the response consists of published reprints from journals, those reprints should be 
275 
from journals that have a publicly stated policy, to which the organization adheres, of full 
276 
disclosure of any conflict of interest or biases for all authors, contributors, or editors associated 
277 
with the journal or organization. 
278 
279 
4. Information distributed in response to an unsolicited request should be scientific in nature. 
280 
281 
When responding to an unsolicited request for information, a firm should respond with material 
282 
that is scientific in tone and presentation. The material should not be promotional in tone or 
283 
presentation. Furthermore, the responsive material should not be distributed along with other 
284 
material or information that is promotional in nature or tone. 
285 
286 
5. Responses to unsolicited requests for information should be generated by medical or scientific 
287 
personnel independent from sales or marketing departments. 
288 
289 
FDA recommends that questions or requests about off-label uses be referred to the firm’s medical 
290 
or scientific representative or department.  FDA recommends that medical or scientific personnel 
291 
have specialized backgrounds in responding to unsolicited requests for information, including 
10 Evaluating evidence of intended use may also involve considering the context in which manufacturer 
communication about an off-label use occurs.  For this reason, FDA’s recommendations in this draft guidance for 
responding to unsolicited requests for information by third parties are not identical to its recommendations regarding 
the spontaneous manufacturer-initiated activity of distributing reprints, as addressed in other FDA guidance.

292 
important training, such as appropriately narrowing questions, tailoring responses only to the 
293 
specific questions being asked, providing unbiased responses, and properly documenting 
294 
responses. 
295 
296 
By contrast, because sales and marketing personnel are focused by training and experience on 
297 
promoting a firm’s products, FDA recommends that sales and marketing personnel have no input 
298 
on the content of responses to unsolicited questions or requests for off-label information. 
299 
300 
6. Information distributed in response to an unsolicited request should be accompanied by the 
301 
following: 
302 
303 
 A copy of the FDA-required labeling, if any, for the product (e.g., FDA-approved package 
304 
insert and, if the response is for a consumer, FDA-approved patient labeling or, for new 
305 
animal drugs, FDA-approved client information sheet) 
306 
 A prominent statement notifying the recipient that FDA has not approved or cleared the 
307 
product as safe and effective for the use addressed in the materials provided 
308 
 A prominent statement disclosing the indication(s) for which FDA has approved or cleared 
309 
the product 
310 
 A prominent statement providing all important safety information including, if applicable, 
311 
any boxed warning for the product 
312 
 A complete list of references for all of the information disseminated in the response (e.g., a 
313 
bibliography of publications in peer-reviewed medical journals or in medical or scientific 
314 
texts; citations for data on file, for summary documents, or for abstracts) 
315 
316 
7. A firm should maintain the following records: 
317 
318 
 The nature of the request for information, including the name, address, and affiliation 
319 
of the requestor 
320 
 Records regarding the information provided to the requestor 
321 
 Any follow-up inquiries or questions from the requestor 
322 
323 
If a firm responds to non-public unsolicited requests for off-label information in the manner 
324 
described above, FDA does not intend to use such responses as evidence of the firm’s intent that 
325 
its product be used for an unapproved or uncleared use.  Such responses also would not be 
326 
expected to comply with the disclosure requirements related to promotional labeling and 
327 
advertising.

VI. 
RESPONDING TO PUBLIC UNSOLICITED REQUESTS FOR OFF-LABEL 
331 
INFORMATION, INCLUDING THOSE ENCOUNTERED THROUGH 
332 
EMERGING ELECTRONIC MEDIA BY DRUG OR MEDICAL DEVICE FIRMS 
333 
334 
This section of the draft guidance makes recommendations about responding to public unsolicited 
335 
requests for off-label information about prescription human and animal drugs (drugs) and medical 
336 
devices (devices), including those that are encountered through emerging electronic media. 
337 
338 
The Internet has revolutionized communication, information-sharing, information exchange among 
339 
systems, and collaboration, enabling consumers to become more proactive about their health and 
340 
safety. Consequently, the Internet has become a widely used medium for manufacturers and 
341 
distributors of FDA-regulated medical products to disseminate information.  The Internet has also 
342 
spawned a variety of social media tools that host online content primarily created and published by 
343 
users other than the intellectual property owner or product manufacturer.  In some cases, this 
344 
online content may not be accurate.  Because consumers increasingly use the Internet to search for 
345 
information about medical conditions and treatments, firms may receive public requests for off­
346 
label information about their products through, for example, product websites, discussion boards, 
347 
chat rooms, or other public electronic forums that they maintain and over which they have full 
348 
control. Firms may also encounter requests for off-label information on third-party sites (i.e., 
349 
websites and other venues that are either entirely independent of a firm’s control and influence or 
350 
not fully controlled by a firm).  Questions about off-label use may be directed to the website users 
351 
at large, rather than specifically to a firm. 
352 
353 
As previously stated in Section II, FDA recognizes that firms are capable of responding to requests 
354 
about their own named products in a truthful, non-misleading, and accurate manner.  Moreover, 
355 
because firms usually have robust and current information about their products, it can be in the 
356 
best interest of public health for a firm to respond to unsolicited requests for information about off­
357 
label uses of the firm’s products that are made in public forums, especially since other responders 
358 
may not provide or have access to the most accurate and up-to-date medical product information. 
359 
360 
However, because product information posted on websites and other public electronic forums is 
361 
likely to be available to a broad audience and for an indefinite period of time, FDA is concerned 
362 
that firms may post detailed public online responses to questions about off-label uses of their 
363 
products in such a way that they are communicating unapproved or uncleared use information 
364 
about FDA-regulated medical products to individuals who have not requested such information.  In 
365 
this circumstance, communications to persons who have not requested information may promote a 
366 
product for a use or condition for which FDA has not approved or cleared.  FDA is also concerned 
367 
about the enduring nature of detailed public online responses to off-label questions because 
368 
specific drug or device information may become outdated (e.g., new risk information may become 
369 
available).

Draft – Not for Implementation 
371 
FDA makes the following recommendations to a firm that chooses to respond to public unsolicited 
372 
requests for off-label information about its product(s), including those encountered through 
373 
emerging electronic media. 
374 
375 
1. If a firm chooses to respond to public unsolicited requests for off-label information, the firm 
376 
should respond only when the request pertains specifically to its own named product (and is 
377 
not solely about a competitor’s product). 
378 
379 
The level of specificity of the question posed in a public forum is important in determining the 
380 
appropriateness of a firm responding to the unsolicited request. 
381 
382 
Example 13:  An individual poses the specific question “Can Drug/Device X be used for Condition 
383 
Y” in a public forum (and this question is not prompted by or on behalf of the firm).  It may be 
384 
appropriate for the firm to respond as outlined below because the question is unsolicited and 
385 
specific to the firm’s named drug or device. 
386 
387 
However, if an individual poses the non-specific question “What drug/device can be used for 
388 
Condition Y” in a public communication thread and the firm manufactures or distributes 
389 
Drug/Device X, which is not FDA-approved or cleared for Condition Y, the firm should not 
390 
respond to the request because the question is not specific to Drug/Device X. 
391 
392 
2. A firm’s public response to public unsolicited requests for off-label information about its 
393 
named product should be limited to providing the firm’s contact information and should not 
394 
include any off-label information. 
395 
396 
 The firm’s public response should convey that the question pertains to an unapproved or 
397 
uncleared use of the product and state that individuals can contact the medical/scientific 
398 
representative or medical affairs department with the specific unsolicited request to obtain 
399 
more information. 
400 
 The firm’s public response should provide specific contact information for the medical or 
401 
scientific personnel or department (e.g., e-mail address, telephone number, facsimile) so 
402 
that individuals can follow up independently with the firm to obtain specific information 
403 
about the off-label use of the product through a non-public, one-on-one communication. 
404 
405 
After an individual has privately contacted a firm for more information regarding an off-label use 
406 
of the firm’s product, the firm should provide a detailed response and maintain records following 
407 
the parameters outlined in Section V of this draft guidance.  Therefore, any substantive 
408 
communication about off-label uses for the product, in response to the original unsolicited off­
409 
label question, should occur solely between the firm and the individual who made the request.  
410 
Regardless of the fact that the original, unsolicited off-label question may have been available to a 
411 
very broad audience, the firm should not make its detailed response with off-label information 
412 
publicly available within the same forum.  For example, after the requestor has contacted the firm 
413 
and provided a personal e-mail address to obtain an answer to the off-label question, the firm’s 
11  


=== PAGE 15 ===

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
Draft – Not for Implementation 
414 
detailed off-label response, within the parameters outlined in Section V of this draft guidance, 
415 
should be e-mailed to the requestor since this resulting communication will occur solely between 
416 
the firm and the specific individual making the unsolicited request for the off-label information. 
417 
418 
3. Representatives who provide public responses to unsolicited requests for off-label information 
419 
should clearly disclose their involvement with a particular firm. 
420 
421 
FDA recommends that a representative who responds to a public request clearly disclose in his/her 
422 
public response that he/she is a particular firm’s representative and inform the requestor of the 
423 
name of the firm representative or department to contact should the individual choose to follow up 
424 
directly with the firm in a non-public forum for detailed information about the unsolicited request 
425 
for off-label information. 
426 
427 
4. Public responses to public unsolicited requests for off-label information described in numbers 
428 
2 and 3 should not be promotional in nature or tone. 
429 
430 
In addition to a firm’s contact and disclosure information, a public response should include a 
431 
mechanism for providing readily accessible current FDA-required labeling, if any, for the product 
432 
(e.g., FDA-approved package insert and, if the response is for a consumer, FDA-approved patient 
433 
labeling or, for new animal drugs, FDA-approved client information sheet).  The public response 
434 
should not provide any promotional information.  For example, a public online response should 
435 
include a direct link to the current FDA-required labeling, if any, but should not include links to 
436 
any other information (e.g., product websites, product promotional materials, firm websites, third­
437 
party websites). Furthermore, the uniform resource locator (URL) or web address where viewers 
438 
are directed to obtain the FDA-required labeling, if any, should not itself be promotional in tone or 
439 
content (e.g., should not be www.bestcancercure.com). 
440 
441 
If a firm responds to public unsolicited requests for off-label information, including those 
442 
encountered through emerging electronic media, in the manner described above, FDA does not 
443 
intend to use such responses as evidence of the firm’s intent that its product be used for an 
444 
unapproved or uncleared use. Such responses also would not be expected to comply with the 
445 
disclosure requirements related to promotional labeling and advertising.
