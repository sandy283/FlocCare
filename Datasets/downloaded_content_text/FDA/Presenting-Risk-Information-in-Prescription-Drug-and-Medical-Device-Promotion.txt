This draft guidance, when finalized, will represent the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) current 
8 
thinking on this topic.  It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to 
9 
bind FDA or the public.  You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of 
10 
the applicable statutes and regulations.  If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA 
11 
staff responsible for implementing this guidance.  If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call

INTRODUCTION  
17 
 
18 
This draft guidance describes factors FDA considers when evaluating advertisements (ads) and 
19 
promotional labeling for prescription drugs,1 ads for restricted medical devices,2 and promotional labeling 
20 
for all medical devices for their compliance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C 
21 
Act or the Act) and relevant regulations.3   The draft guidance discusses factors that are relevant to the 
22 
disclosure of risk information and provides numerous examples to illustrate FDA’s thinking on these 
23 
factors.  This guidance responds to stakeholder requests for specific guidance on how FDA evaluates 
24 
prescription drug and medical device promotional pieces to determine whether they adequately present 
25 
risk information.  The recommendations contained in this draft guidance apply to promotional materials 
26 
directed to both consumers and healthcare professionals.   
27 
 
28 
 
                                                     
1  This draft guidance does not address over-the-counter (OTC) drug promotional labeling, which FDA also 
regulates.  FDA encourages all manufacturers to ensure that t heir promotional l abeling is truthful and non-
misleading.  FDA recognizes that the marketing status of animal drugs may vary, depending upon the intended 
species.  For example, several anthelmintics on the market are available only by prescription for dogs and cats, yet 
very similar products are available OTC for horses and food animals.  OTC drugs intended for food animals, in 
particular, may carry significant risks that may affect not only the intended food animal, but also other animal 
species and humans.  OTC promotional labeling for animal drugs should convey the serious risks associated with 
use of the products, especially those affecting the public health.   
2 Devices may become restricted, either by regulation issued under section 520(e) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 360j(e), or 
by order approving an application for premarket approval (PMA), pursuant to section 515(d)(1)(B)(ii) (21 U.S.C. 
360e(d)(1)(B)(ii)). 
3 This draft guidance also does not apply to those reminder promotions (labeling or advertising that calls attention to 
the name of a drug or device but does not include indications, dosage recommendations, or other information) that 
are exempted by regulation from the requirements under the FD&C Act for the disclosure of risk information.  See 
21 CFR 200.200, 201.100(f), 201.105(d)(2), 202.1(e)(2)(i), 801.109(d).  But see 21 U.S.C. 352(r) (requiring certain 
risk information in all restricted device advertisements).

Although this draft guidance focuses on the presentation of risk information in prescription drug and 
30 
medical device promotion, the factors relating to effective communication outlined below are also 
31 
applicable to the presentation of benefit information in promotion.  Indeed, when FDA evaluates 
32 
promotional pieces for compliance with the Act and relevant regulations, it determines whether claims 
33 
about both risk and benefit of the product are accurate and non-misleading, and it also looks at whether 
34 
risks and benefits are presented in a comparably prominent manner.  Thus, considerations involving the 
35 
content and format of benefit information are an inherent part of FDA’s evaluation of risk presentations in 
36 
promotional pieces.  FDA recommends that companies take the factors outlined in this document into 
37 
account when developing both risk and benefit presentations in their promotional pieces, as the public 
38 
health is best served when risk and effectiveness information about drug and device products is clearly 
39 
and accurately communicated. 
40 
 
41 
FDA’s guidance documents, including this draft guidance, do not establish legally enforceable 
42 
responsibilities.  Instead, guidances describe FDA’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed 
43 
only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited.  The use of the 
44 
word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.  
45

47 
II. 
BACKGROUND 
 
48 
 
49 
The regulation of prescription drug and medical device promotion to healthcare professionals and 
50 
consumers is a broad and complex topic.4   This document addresses one key aspect of this topic – the 
51 
presentation of risk information.  FDA believes it is critically important to disclose risk information in 
52 
prescription drug and medical device promotion appropriately and effectively to healthcare professionals 
53 
and consumers.5  This information helps consumers know whether drugs or devices may be appropriate 
54 
for them as well as what they should tell their healthcare professionals about before taking or using or 
55 
while taking or using a product.  It also lets consumers know what risks they might experience and what 
56 
steps they need to take for safety reasons (e.g., no driving) because of taking or using a product.  
57 
Appropriate risk disclosures help healthcare professionals by giving them some of the information they 
58 
need to know about the product that will enable them to safely use or prescribe it. Recently published 
59 
industry guidelines encourage manufacturers to develop prescription medicine promotion that is 
                                                     
4 Although beyond the scope of this document, the complexity of the topic can be demonstrated by past studies that 
have shown potential positive and negative effects of direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising for prescription drugs.  
For example, FDA research suggests that DTC advertising seems to increase awareness of conditions and 
treatments, to motivate questions for the healthcare provider, and to help patients ask better questions.  Yet this 
research also suggests that almost half of physicians feel some pressure to prescribe as a result of DTC advertising, 
and patients and physicians report a belief that these ads overs
 
tate the drug product’s efficacy and do not present a 
fair balance of benefit and risk information.  For the complete study results, see K. Aikin, J. Swasy & A. Braman, 
Patient and Physician Attitudes and Behaviors Associated With DTC Promotion of Prescription Drugs – Summary 
of FDA Survey Research Results, Final Report, November 19, 2004, available at: 
http://www.fda.gov/cder/ddmac/Final%20Report/FRfinal111904.pdf. 
5   Effectively disclosing risk information also requires a consideration of whether an advertisement or promotional 
material over warns.  For example, a drug advertisement that includes a listing of side effects that are not included in 
the drug's approved labeling may lead to under-emphasis of th
 e most important and serious risks.  FDA takes care to 
ensure that important risk information is included i n the drug's approved lab
 
eling, and sponsors have an obligation to 
update their labeling with appropriate new safety information.  21 CFR 201.57(c)(6); 201.80(e).  Nothing in th
 is 
guidance should be construed as recommending that the sponsor of a dr
 
ug include in advertising or promotional 
materials risk in
 formation not in t he product's approved labeling o r appropriate for inclusion in th
 e labeling.  See 73 
Fed. Reg. 2848, 2851 (January 16, 2008).

61 
advertised” product.6 
62 
63 
However, omission or minimization of risk information is the most frequent violation of the regulations 
64 
cited in advertising and promotion enforcement letters sent to sponsors, and illustrative research in one of 
65 
the areas this guidance covers, direct-to-consumer prescription drug advertising, has shown that 60 
66 
percent of patients believe ads directed at them do not provide enough information about risks, 60 percent 
67 
of physicians believe that patients have little or no understanding from these ads about what the possible 
68 
risks and negative effects of the products are, and 72 percent of physicians believe that patients have little 
69 
or no understanding from these ads about who should not use the product.7 
70 
71 
FDA is issuing this draft guidance to aid sponsors in effectively communicating risk information in their 
72 
promotion to both healthcare professionals and consumers.  This draft guidance describes how FDA 
73 
reviews prescription drug and medical device promotional pieces to determine whether they adequately 
74 
present risk information. The document begins with some background information, including a brief 
75 
overview of legal requirements and a discussion of policy considerations related to drug and device 
76 
promotional materials.  The draft guidance then describes factors FDA considers when reviewing risk 
77 
communication in promotional materials.  Because the principles within this guidance are based on 
78 
universal concepts of communication and understanding of risk information, the guidance will address 
79 
promotion aimed at both lay consumer and healthcare professional audiences.

81 
A. 
LEGAL OVERVIEW 
82 
83 
Under the FD&C Act and FDA's implementing regulations, promotional pieces (such as promotional 
84 
labeling for drugs and devices and advertisements for prescription drugs and restricted devices) making 
85 
claims about a product are deemed misleading if they fail to disclose certain information about the 
86 
product's risks.8  Generally, to comply with the FD&C Act and FDA’s implementing regulations, such 
87 
promotional pieces:9 
88 
89 
— Cannot be false or misleading in any particular10 
90 
— Must reveal material facts about the product being promoted, including facts about the 
91 
consequences that can result from use of the product as suggested in the promotional piece11

8 The relevant statutory provisions and regulations are discussed in more detail in the Attachment to this guidance. 
9 The terms promotional piece, promotional materials, and promotional communications are used in this guidance to 
refer generally to both advertising and promotional labeling, regardless of format. Promotional materials include, 
among others, television ads, brochures, booklets, detailing pieces, internet web sites, print ads, exhibits, and sound 
recordings or radio ads. As noted in the introduction, this guidance applies to all types of promotion for prescription 
drugs, advertisements for restricted devices and promotional labeling for all devices.  
10 Drugs and devices are misbranded under the Act if their labeling is false or misleading in any particular (21 
U.S.C. 352(a)). Similarly, prescription drugs and restricted devices are misbranded if their advertising is false or 
misleading in any particular (21 U.S.C. 352(n) & (q)(1); 21 CFR 202.1(e)(5)(i)).

96 
This draft guidance document describes factors FDA considers when evaluating risk disclosure in 
97 
prescription drug and medical device promotional materials to determine whether these materials comply 
98 
with the statutory and regulatory requirements.  The draft guidance also makes recommendations about 
99 
how manufacturers can develop the content and format of promotional communications to comply with 
100 
these requirements. The examples and recommendations provided are intended to provide guidance and 
101 
illustrate possible approaches; manufacturers are free to use alternative approaches if these approaches 
102 
satisfy the requirements of the statute and regulations. Unless otherwise specified in this draft guidance, 
103 
the principles set forth below apply to all promotional pieces, regardless of the medium used or the target 
104 
audience. 
105 
106 
B. 
POLICY OVERVIEW 
107 
108 
Section III of this guidance highlights several factors, including those related to content and format, that 
109 
FDA uses to evaluate the risk communication in a promotional piece.  We recommend that manufacturers 
110 
consider these factors when trying to achieve effective risk communication.  It is important to emphasize 
111 
that when FDA evaluates the risk communication in a promotional piece, FDA looks not just at specific 
112 
risk-related statements, but at the net impression – i.e., the message communicated by all elements of the 
113 
piece as a whole.  The purpose of the evaluation is to determine whether the piece as a whole conveys an 
114 
accurate and non-misleading impression of the benefits and risks of the promoted product.  Manufacturers 
115 
should therefore focus not just on individual claims or presentations, but on the promotional piece as a 
116 
whole.13 A promotional communication that conveys a deceptive net impression of the product could be 
117 
misleading, even if specific individual claims or presentations are not misleading. 
118 
119 
FDA’s consideration of the net impression of risk information is based on well-developed social science 
120 
principles supported by decades of scientific research14 and is consistent with the approach of other 
121 
agencies and organizations.  For example, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) uses the interpretation of 
122 
the net impression of the piece to determine whether a promotional piece is likely to mislead a 
123 
consumer.15 Pharmaceutical industry members have also conducted social science research showing that, 
124 
when evaluating a promotional piece, the net impression conveyed by the piece as a whole is an important 
125 
element to consider, independent of individual statements within the piece.   
11 21 U.S.C. 321(n); 21 CFR 1.21 & 202.1(e)(5)(iii). 
12 See 21 CFR 202.1(e)(5)(ii). 
13 Manufacturers should note that, although this guidance focuses on risk disclosures in promotional pieces, any 
claims in a promotional piece that are misleading, whether risk-related or not, can cause the product being promoted 
to become misbranded ( 21 U.S.C. 352(a), (n) & (q)(1); 21 CFR 202.1(e)(5)(i)).

page references to 103 F.T.C. 110).

126 
127 
Section III of the guidance contains examples of how various aspects of content and format can contribute 
128 
to a misleading net impression in promotional pieces.  The following two examples also illustrate this. 
129 
130 
Example 1: A broadcast television ad for a cholesterol-lowering drug contains a factually 
131 
accurate audio risk statement that discloses the drug’s major side effects and contraindications.  
132 
This audio presentation is accompanied by quick scene changes showing comforting visual 
133 
images of patients benefiting from the drug.  It is also accompanied by loud, upbeat music. In 
134 
this case, the audio disclosure may not adequately communicate risks because of the 
135 
accompanying discordant visuals and distracting music. 
136 
137 
Example 2: A one-page prescription drug ad for an arthritis drug, run in a medical journal, 
138 
prominently presents the following headline claims in large bolded font and with abundant 
139 
surrounding white space: 
140 
• 
Benefits! DrugX is proven safe and effective for the relief  of arthritis pain and 
141 
stiffness, 
142 
• 
Difference! DrugX’s unique gel formulation is convenient and easy to use, and 
143 
• 
Reason to Believe! Drug X is the most frequently prescribed arthritis drug in the 
144 
United States 
145 
The bottom of the page contains an inconspicuous statement in small, non-bolded font and 
146 
without surrounding white space:  “Like all arthritis medications, Drug X has been associated 
147 
with a risk of serious infection.” The emphasis on benefit information in this piece – in terms of 
148 
the way the information is formatted and framed – overwhelms the risk information and may 
149 
cause readers to receive an erroneous impression that the drug is safer than it has proven to be, 
150 
even though the statements themselves may be factually accurate.  
151 
152 
Using the factors explained in Part III of this draft guidance, trained professionals at FDA with expertise 
153 
in areas including communication, drug information, medicine and law, apply these factors and evaluate 
154 
claims in promotional pieces from the perspective of a reasonable consumer. As FDA has stated,16 the 
155 
agency believes that the reasonable consumer standard is the appropriate standard to use in determining 
156 
whether a claim in the labeling of a dietary supplement or conventional food is misleading.  The agency 
157 
confirms that the reasonable consumer standard will be used to evaluate communications covered by this 
158 
guidance document.  The reasonable consumer standard used by FDA in evaluating promotional 
159 
materials is similar to the FTC standard: 
160 
161 
[W]e examine the practice from the perspective of a consumer acting reasonably in the 
162 
circumstances.  If the representation or practice affects or is directed primarily to a 
163 
particular group, the Commission examines reasonableness from the perspective of that 
17
164 
group.
165 
16 Guidance for Industry: Qualified Health Claims in the Labeling of Conventional Foods and Dietary Supplements 
(Dec. 2002) (replaced by Guidance for Industry and FDA: Interim Procedures for Qualified Health Claims in the 
Labeling of Conventional Food and Human Dietary Supplements (July 2003)); see 70 Fed. Reg. 824 (Jan. 5, 2005) 
(noting that, although the Guidance for Industry on Qualified Health Claims in Labeling of Conventional Foods and

This standard does not preclude multiple interpretations of a claim, as long as they are reasonable. As the 
167 
FTC’s Policy Statement provides: 
168 
169 
To be considered reasonable, the interpretation or reaction does not have to be the only 
170 
one.  When a seller’s representation conveys more than one meaning to reasonable 
171 
consumers, one of which is false, the seller is liable for the misleading interpretation.18 
172 
173 
In applying the reasonable consumer standard, FDA, like FTC, takes into account the different levels of 
174 
expertise of lay consumers and healthcare professionals. Due to their training and experience, healthcare 
175 
professionals develop a level of knowledge related to scientific concepts and medical conditions and 
176 
products that lay consumers do not possess. FDA takes this difference in knowledge and experience into 
177 
account when assessing promotional materials directed at healthcare professionals versus those directed at 
178 
lay audiences.  However, research has shown that experts (in this case, healthcare professionals) are 
179 
subject to the same cognitive biases and processing limitations as non-experts.19 
180 
181 
Cognitive science research has demonstrated that all people, regardless of expertise, are only able to think 
182 
through and process a limited amount of information at one time.20  However, our ability to process 
183 
information can be greatly improved by considering and controlling for the factors that affect attention 
184 
and comprehension. This guidance discusses those factors, how we apply them to our review of 
185 
promotional materials, and what manufacturers can do to ensure that their materials comply with the 
186 
regulations.

III. 
FACTORS CONSIDERED IN THE REVIEW OF RISK COMMUNICATION 
190 
191 
FDA relies on a vast scientific body of knowledge regarding human cognition in assessing which factors 
192 
to consider in evaluating promotional pieces and making regulatory decisions about the presentation of 
193 
risk information.  The following sections highlight factors that FDA considers when determining whether 
194 
risk information is communicated in a fashion consistent with the regulations.

19 Although physicians generally do not believe that they are influenced by advertising, (Spiller & Wymer, 2001), 
research has shown that physicians are influenced by promotional activities (e.g., advertising: Avorn et al., 1982; 
sales representatives: Gonul et al., 2001). Avorn, J., Chen, M. & Hartley, R. (1982) Scientific versus commercial

A. 
GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
197 
 
198 
This section explores some important factors that relate to both the content and the format of a 
199 
promotional piece.  FDA will consider the use of language and signals and how information is framed and 
200 
ordered. 
201 
 
202 
1. 
Consistent Use of Language Appropriate for Target Audience 
203 
 
204 
Both language used to communicate benefits and language used to communicate risks should be 
205 
comprehensible to the same audience for a piece to be considered accurate and non-misleading.  Thus, 
206 
promotional materials directed to professionals can reasonably describe benefits and risks in medical 
207 
language, but promotional materials directed to consumers should convey benefits and risks in language 
208 
understandable to consumers.21   
209 
 
210 
Example 3: A consumer-directed ad for a drug that presents benefit claims in consumer friendly 
211 
language should mention a risk of “fainting,” not “syncope.”   
212 
 
213 
With respect to consumer-directed materials, FDA encourages manufacturers to present both benefit and 
214 
risk information in clear, understandable, and non-technical language for consumer audiences.22     
215 
 
216 
2. 
Use of Signals 
217 
 
218 
Signaling is an important component of information communication.23   In written materials, signaling has 
219 
been defined as the use of “writing devices designed to emphasize aspects of a text’s structure or content 
220 
without altering the information in the text.”24   Headlines and subheads are examples of commonly used 
221 
signals.25   Depending on the circumstance, “accurate information in the text may not remedy a false 
222 
headline [or signal] because reasonable consumers may only glance at the headline” and skip the 
                                                     
21 See Root, J., & Stableford, S. (1999) Easy-to-read consumer communications: A
  missing link in Medicaid 
managed care. Journal of Health Politics, Policy, & Law, 24, 1-26. 
22 Although not a true measure of “understandability,” text reading level, often expressed as “grade level,” is one 
way to assess text difficulty.  Text that scores at 
 
a higher grade level (e.g., 12th  grade) is considered more complex 
than text scoring at a lower grade level (e.g., 8th grade).  Several validated reading level measures are available to 
provide an approximate measure of text complexity.  See, e.g., Kincaid, J.P., Fishburne, R., Rogers, R.L., Chissom, 
B.S. (1975) Derivation of New Readability Formulas (Automated Reliability Index, Fog Count, and Flesch Reading 
Ease Formula) for Navy Enlisted Personnel.  Research Branch Report 8-75.  Memphis: Naval Air Station;

P.B. (1998) A new measure of assessing document complexity: The PMOSE/IKIRSCH document readability 
formula. Journal of Adolescent and Adult Literacy, 41, 620-638.  We encourage manufacturers to test text 
comprehensibility as well.

223 
remainder of the text.26   Signals are also used in broadcast situations, such as when an announcer draws 
224 
attention to different items of information, when a word on the screen identifies a new topic, or when 
225 
headlines emphasize some messages but not others.   
226 
 
227 
When reviewing promotional materials, FDA looks to see if the use of signals is consistent across benefit 
228 
and risk information, so that the materials provide accurate and non-misleading impressions of a drug or 
229 
device.  
230 
 
231 
Example 4: If a piece contains headlines that signal benefit information, (e.g., “Drug X Provides 
232 
Highly Effective Control”), some sort of headline should also signal risk information (e.g., “Side 
233 
Effects for Drug X”).   
234 
 
235 
However, the mere presence of similar signals for both benefit and risk information is not necessarily 
236 
sufficient to make a piece accurate and non-misleading.  The content of the signals is also important.  
237 
Certain headlines may frame (see next section) subsequent risk information in ways that emphasize or 
238 
minimize its importance.   
239 
 
240 
Example 5:  The headline “Important Risk Information about Device X” is preferable to 
241 
“Important Information about Device X” because the former headline indicates what type of 
242 
information follows.  Similarly, “Common Side Effects Seen with Drug X,” is preferable to 
243 
“Other Information about Drug X.”  Specific and clear signals are preferable because they are 
244 
more effective than vague or abstract terms.   
245 
 
246 
Presenting risk information with no signal, or beginning the presentation of risk information with 
247 
unrelated information (e.g. presenting risk information in a paragraph that begins with information on 
248 
indication or dosing) can also minimize the risks of the product and mislead the audience.  For example, 
249 
the headlines in the following example convey additional benefit information, potentially misleading the 
250 
audience about the overall risk-benefit profile of the product. 
251 
 
252 
Example 6: Placing risk information under headlines such as “Now Approved for Epilepsy” or 
253 
“Safe Enough for Children Under 5” minimizes the risk information that follows, particularly if 
254 
individuals only look at the headlines.  Instead, headlines preceding risk presentations should 
255 
signal that a risk presentation follows, for example, “Important Risk Information About Drug X.” 
256 
 
257 
In videos, broadcast ads, and other promotional pieces with audio components, a change of announcer or 
258 
a statement in the audio portion of the piece to signal to the audience that risk information follows can aid 
259 
effective communication.  However, manufacturers should consider comparable voice characteristics, as 
260 
discussed in Section III.C.2.  Risk information may also be signaled graphically or visually.  Similar to 
261 
print pieces, specific and straightforward audio signals are most likely to adequately convey risk 
262 
information.    
263 
 
264 
3. 
Framing Risk Information 
265 
 
266 
FDA evaluates how risk information is framed because framing can affect the presentation of risks and 
267 
benefits in a promotional piece.  Framing commonly refers to how a particular piece of information is 
268 
stated or conveyed, such as by emphasizing either the positive or negative aspects of the information or 
269 
by presenting the information in vague versus specific terms.  Research consistently shows that framing 
                                                     
26 FTC Policy Statement on Deception at 182.

270 
the same information in different ways can change the way audience members respond to that 
271 
information.27   Thus, the way information is phrased can significantly influence the message the audience 
272 
receives from a promotional piece. 
273 
 
274 
Framing risk information in non-specific terms can undermine the effective communication of that 
275 
information to the audience.  Risk information should be presented in the same terms or with the same 
276 
degree of specificity as benefit information.  For example, if a promotional piece refers to the product by 
277 
name in presenting efficacy information, it should refer to the product by name in presenting risk 
278 
information, rather than by referring to the product’s device or drug class.  
279 
 
280 
Example 7: If the benefit information refers to the brand name, “Drug X,” then “Common side 
281 
effects associated with Drug X” would be preferable to “Common side effects associated with 
282 
[the generic name].”   
283 
 
284 
Moreover, within the risk information presentation, phrases such as “Like all medicines, Drug X has some 
285 
side effects,” may have the effect of minimizing the risks that follow.  Framing risk information in a way 
286 
that minimizes the severity of a risk event may also cause a promotional piece to be considered false or 
287 
misleading.   
288 
 
289 
Example 8: If a drug’s package insert contains a boxed warning about the risk of life-threatening 
290 
fevers associated with its use and reports that 55 percent of patients taking the drug experience 
291 
dizziness, a statement such as “Adverse events associated with drug X include fevers.  Some 
292 
patients experienced dizziness” misleadingly describes the risk profile of the drug by failing to 
293 
convey the seriousness of the fevers and the frequency of the dizziness.  Statements like “Life-
294 
threatening fevers have been reported with the use of Drug X” and “More than half of patients 
295 
taking Drug X experienced dizziness” would convey the seriousness and frequency of the two 
296 
risks appropriately. 
297 
 
298 
In addition, the risks conveyed in the piece should be framed in a way that accurately reflects their nature. 
299 
 
300 
Example 9: A statement such as “continuation of therapy may necessitate certain monitoring” is 
301 
too vague for a product that requires monthly blood tests to check for liver damage.  This 
302 
statement fails to convey the risk of liver damage and also misleadingly suggests that routine 
303 
monitoring may not be necessary for some patients.  A statement like “Monthly blood tests 
304 
should be performed to check for liver damage” would accurately convey the type of monitoring 
305 
needed and the risk involved. 
306 
 
307 
4. 
Hierarchy of Risk Information 
308 
 
309 
FDA considers the ordering of risks within a presentation an important factor in determining the risk 
310 
profile conveyed by a piece, regardless of whether it is directed toward healthcare professionals or 
                                                     
27  See Armstrong, K., Schwartz, J.S., Fitzgerald, G., P
 utt, M., & Ubel, P.A. (2002) Effect of f raming as gain versus 
loss on understanding and hyp
 
othetical treatment choices: survival and mortality curves.  Medical Decision Making, 
22, 76-83; Dunegan, K.J. (1993) Fram
 
ing, cognitive modes, and imagery theory: Toward an understanding of a glas

311 
consumers.  As discussed in Section III.B.2 (below) and reflected in the format of the package insert for 
312 
prescription drugs and medical devices, risks associated with a specific product are assigned a hierarchy 
313 
of importance.   
314 
 
315 
Memory research consistently shows that, in an experimental setting, when people process an entire list or 
316 
text, they are better able to recall items at the beginning and the end than items in the middle.28   
317 
Consequently, in a broadcast ad, where viewers do not have the opportunity to control the speed at which 
318 
information is presented to help them to process it, the beginning or end, or both, should be reserved for 
319 
the most important risk information.  On the other hand, w
 hen reading a print promotional piece under 
320 
normal circumstances, readers may lose interest toward the end of a lengthy paragraph, and it is not likely 
 
321 
that the information at the end will be as well-comprehended as the information at the beginning.  If a 
322 
product’s most important risks are located in the middle of a list of less important risks, the important 
323 
risks may not be effectively communicated.  FDA therefore recommends that the most important risk 
324 
information, including relevant warnings and contraindications, be placed or stated first, especially in 
325 
print materials.  As discussed in Section III.C.1 (below), manufacturers should also note, however, that 
326 
risk information should not just be presented in one location in a piece, but should, like benefit 
327 
information, appear as an integral part of the piece.     
328 
 
329 
FDA also considers the order in which risk information is presented to determine whether this ordering 
330 
suggests that certain risks apply only to certain populations or only under certain conditions when this is 
331 
not the case.   
332 
 
333 
Example 10: A statement in a broadcast ad that “Patients should not drink alcohol when taking 
334 
Drug X.  Common side effects are drowsiness and nausea” may suggest that these side effects 
335 
occur only if alcohol is consumed when taking the drug.  Instead, the sponsor should consider 
336 
adding intervening information or changing the order of the presentation so that it is clear the side 
337 
effects listed are not caused by drinking alcohol while taking the drug. 
338 
 
339 
B. 
CONSIDERATIONS OF CONTENT  
340 
 
341 
This section discusses how FDA evaluates the content of risk presentations in determining whether a 
342 
promotional piece is accurate and non-misleading. 
343 
 
344 
1. 
Quantity  
345 
 
346 
One content factor FDA considers is the amount or quantity of information conveyed by a promotional 
347 
piece.  For example, a 30-second broadcast ad is likely to present less information than a 60-second 
348 
broadcast ad.  As the amount of benefit information conveyed increases, the amount of risk information 
349 
conveyed should similarly increase.   
350 
 
351 
The quantity of information presented can affect the net impression of the piece.  The amount of 
352 
information presented is one component that, together with choice of words, color, graphics, voiceover, 
353 
and other aspects of the piece, can affect cognitive load, the mental effort required to understand the 
                                                     
28 See Botvinik, M.M., & Plaut, D.C. (2006) Short-term memory for serial order: A recurrent neural network model.

primacy, and memory: Reappraising and standardizing the serial position curve.  Cortex, 28, 315-342; Murdock, 
B.B. (1962) The serial position effect of free recall.  Journal of Experimental Psychology, 64, 482-488.

354 
various components of information in the piece.29  If the benefit information is easily understood and 
355 
maintained through repetition or other reinforcing techniques, and the risk information is not similarly 
356 
reinforced, the net impression may not be appropriately balanced.   
357 
358 
To ensure comparable benefit and risk presentations, manufacturers should consider the space or time 
359 
devoted to benefits and risks, the comprehensibility of the language used, and the information provided 
360 
on benefits and risks. FDA will look to see that promotional communications allot sufficient time and 
361 
space to convey the important benefits and risks of the product being promoted to ensure that, as a whole, 
362 
the communication provides an accurate and non-misleading impression of the product. 
363 
364 
A promotional piece with several paragraphs of information regarding benefits differs from a piece 
365 
consisting mainly of one-line benefit claims.  The treatment of risk information in each piece should be 
366 
comparable to the treatment of benefit information, including how it is conveyed. 
367 
368 
Promotional pieces do not have to convey an identical number of benefits and risks, and a given drug or 
369 
device may have few or many risks.30  FDA considers these factors when determining the comparability 
370 
of benefits and risks in a piece: 
371 
372 
— The number of statements about benefits and risks 
373 
— The completeness and depth of detail given about benefits and risks 
374 
— The amount of time (in both the audio and visual portions) devoted to benefits and risks in a 
375 
video, audio, or broadcast communication 
376 
— The amount of space devoted to benefits and risks in a print communication 
377 
— The use of audio or visual components that enhance or distract from the presentation of risk 
378 
or benefit information 
379 
380 
As stated in the Background and discussed above, FDA evaluates the net impression created by 
381 
promotional communications.  This evaluation includes considering the above factors as well as the 
382 
differences in the inherent risks associated with various drugs or devices. Simply satisfying one of the 
383 
above factors (e.g., devoting the same amount of time or space to risk and benefit information) will not 
384 
necessarily make a promotional piece accurate and non-misleading. Furthermore, certain important risk 
385 
information should be in all promotional pieces regardless of their length (see Section III.B.2 below). 
386 
387 
2. 
Materiality and Comprehensiveness  
388 
389 
Generally speaking, materiality is determined by the degree to which information is objectively 
390 
important, relevant, or substantial to the target audience. A promotional piece that omits material 
391 
information about a product’s risks could be considered misleading even if the piece devotes similar 
392 
space or time to risk and effectiveness presentations.31 
29 See Mayer, R.E., & Moreno, R. (2003) Nine ways to reduce cognitive load in multimedia learning. Educational 
Psychologist, 38, 43-52; Pass, F., Renkl, A., & Sweller, J. (2004) Cognitive load theory: Instructional implications 
of the interaction between information structures and cognitive architecture.  Instructional Science, 32, 1-8.   
30 If the drug or device being promoted is associated with a minimal number of risks, and all of these risks are 
conveyed in a format that is comparably prominent to the presentation of benefit information, then the risk 
presentation in such an ad or promotional labeling piece would be considered accurate, non-misleading and balanced 
even if the ad presented several more benefit than risk claims.

description of the relevant requirements.

they are the intended audience) about a product.  Material facts include those that influence such people’s 
396 
understanding of the following: 
397 
398 
— The relevant properties of a product 
399 
— Whether or not the product is appropriate for them or their patients 
400 
— Whether or not they are willing to accept the risks or burdens associated with using or 
401 
prescribing a product 
402 
403 
Some drug and device risks are material regardless of the amount or type of benefit claims in a piece. 
404 
The most serious risks set forth in a product’s labeling are generally material to any presentation of 
405 
efficacy. A promotional piece that communicates a product’s benefits should similarly communicate the 
406 
most serious risks involved in using the product. Similarly, the most frequently occurring risks would 
407 
usually be material to consumers and healthcare professionals in promotion, particularly if a product is 
408 
only associated with a small number of more serious risks, because of the likelihood that they will affect 
409 
patients taking the drug or using the device. 
410 
411 
• 
Consideration of Target Audience 
412 
413 
FDA considers the target audience of a promotional piece to be critical in determining what risk 
414 
information is material.  FDA evaluates the promotion from the perspective of a reasonable member of 
415 
the targeted population (e.g., consumers, specific patient populations, healthcare professionals).  As is 
416 
explored in more detail below (e.g., Examples 11 and 13), different information can be material to 
417 
different audiences. For example, in a piece promoting use of a product in a selected class of patients, 
418 
risks especially applicable to that selected class of patients are material (see “The Nature of Benefit 
419 
Claims,” below).32 
420 
421 
Generally speaking, communications directed to healthcare professionals should convey the most critical 
422 
information they need to know about the product to help them decide whether it is appropriate for their 
423 
patients and to help enable them to safely use the product or counsel patients on the safe use of the 
424 
product. Consumer-directed communications should generally convey the following: 
425 
426 
— What the drug or device is used for 
427 
— Who should or should not take a drug or use a device 
428 
— What can be expected from a drug or device 
429 
— What patients should ask their healthcare professionals about a drug or device 
430 
— What patients should tell their healthcare professionals about before or while taking a drug or 
431 
using a device 
432 
433 
Example 11: A drug’s package insert includes a warning for healthcare professionals about dosing 
434 
adjustments in patients with kidney disease. This information is material for healthcare professionals, 
435 
both because of the seriousness indicated by its warning status and because of its relevance to safe 
436 
prescribing. However, although this information is important to the safe use of the drug and should 
437 
be considered by prescribers, it is not material to consumers, although the reasons for such care in 
438 
dosing (e.g., the consequences of inappropriate dosing) could be.

• 
Importance of Package Insert 
441 
 
442 
In determining the materiality of the risks associated with a drug or device, FDA refers to the product’s 
443 
package insert. FDA is more likely to consider as important or material a product’s most serious or most 
444 
frequently occurring risks than a product’s less serious or less commonly occurring risks.33   FDA 
445 
characterizes the risks associated with a specific product along a hierarchy of importance reflected by 
446 
placement in a risk-related section of the product’s package insert – traditionally , the Contraindications, 
447 
Warnings or Hazards, Precautions, Adverse Reactions or Side Effects sections, as well as the  
448 
Overdosage, and Drug Abuse and Dependence sections in the case of prescription drugs – and in the use 
449 
of various means to emphasize certain risks, such as boxed warnings and bolded statements.  For labeling 
450 
that complies with the new formatting requirements in the recently finalized Physician Labeling Rule for 
451 
prescription drugs,34 the risk-related sections include Boxed Warning, Contraindications, Warnings and 
452 
Precautions, Adverse Reactions, Drug Interactions, Use in Specific Populations, Drug Abuse & 
453 
Dependence, and Overdosage. 
454 
 
455 
For prescription drug physician labeling that follows the new requirements, the risks included in the 
456 
Highlights section of labeling are the most important risks associated with the drug.  For other labeling, 
457 
contraindications and warnings or hazards are considered to contain the most serious and material risk 
458 
information associated with a drug or device and convey information that must be understood before the 
459 
product is prescribed or used.  Contraindications and boxed warnings are generally considered the most 
460 
important.  Precautions also convey important risk information that can help healthcare professionals and 
461 
patients use a drug or device more safely.  These include ways to avoid adverse effects and information 
462 
about important differences in individual response and, for drugs, about interactions w
 
ith other drugs or 
463 
food.  Risks conveyed only in the adverse events or side effects section are generally less serious or less 
464 
well-documented than those in the preceding three categories.  They are often the most commonly 
465 
experienced risks associated with a product, however, and they therefore may constitute important 
466 
information for both healthcare professionals and consumers.  
467 
  
468 
• 
The Nature of Benefit Claims 
469 
 
470 
Promotional pieces should reveal risk information that is material in light of the specific benefit claims 
471 
made in the piece.   
472 
 
473 
Example 12: If a piece claims convenience because the promoted drug is dosed once-weekly, 
474 
information about risks directly related to the regimen’s convenience is material.  Such risk 
475 
information might include, for example, that inflammatory reactions such as swelling have been 
476 
reported at the application site for a topical product, or that patients must restrict their activities 
477 
for some time after taking an oral medication because of a risk of fainting.  
                                                     
33 As indicated above, the most seri
 
ous risks set forth in a product’s labeling are generally material to
  any 
presentation of efficacy.  Frequently occurring, less s erious risks (e.g., thos
 
e reflected in Adverse Reactions) can be 
material, particularly for a product that is not associated with serious risks, but these less serious risks may not be 
material for a product that has many serious risks that need to be disclosed in promotion, or whose most frequently 
occurring risks occur at a very low rate.  In general, FDA believes that exhaustive lists of minor risks distract from 
and make it difficult to comprehend and retain information on the more important risks. To this end, we have issued 
a draft guidance for prescription drugs entitled Brief Summary Disclosing Risk Information in Consumer-Directed 
Print Advertisements, which suggests approaches to communicating less, but better, information in consumer brief 
summaries.  Once finalized, this guidance will represent the Agency's thinking on th
 is topic. 
34  See 71 Fed. Reg. 3922 (Jan. 24, 2006).  The rule became effective June 30, 2006.

478 
 
479 
Similarly, as stated above, for promotional pieces that promote a product’s benefits in a selected class of 
480 
patients, the significant risks applicable to that class of patients are material.35    
481 
 
482 
Example 13: If a Web site for a product approved to treat high blood pressure presents 
483 
information about a product’s benefits in postmenopausal women, any risks specific to 
484 
postmenopausal women are particularly material. 
485 
 
486 
• 
Accuracy and Comprehensiveness of Risk Information 
487 
 
488 
When it evaluates the content of a promotional piece’s risk information, FDA assesses the quality as well 
489 
as the quantity of the information.  Both consumer and professional audiences expect that certain 
490 
information will be present in promotions for prescription drugs and medical devices.  This expectation 
491 
results from schemas,36 or mental frameworks, about these promotional pieces that have developed from 
492 
previous exposures (i.e., preconceived expectations based on past experience).  Consumers have 
493 
preconceived ideas about the amount of scrutiny these ads undergo.  Many believe FDA exercises tight 
494 
regulatory control over the content of these ads and to some extent, believe that all ads have been pre-
495 
reviewed prior to airing.37   As a result, consumers are likely to expect that the most relevant risks have 
496 
been included in the ad.  Because people expect to see risk information, there is no reason for them to 
497 
imagine that the product has important risks that have been omitted.  Instead, the audience is likely to 
498 
believe that all significant risks are included, especially if some risks are included.  This missing risk 
499 
information can have serious effects; it may cause consumers to fail to inform their healthcare 
500 
professionals of important considerations, and healthcare professionals to prescribe inappropriately or 
501 
even dangerously. 
502 
 
503 
Example 14: A product is associated with the rare but serious risk of a heart attack.  FDA is likely 
504 
to consider an ad misleading if it devotes a certain amount of time or space to the presentation of 
505 
claims about the product’s efficacy in treating migraines and then devotes a similar amount of 
506 
time or space to describing only the frequently occurring, least serious adverse events, or only 
507 
one of several significant risks.   
508 
 
509 
Even though a similar quantity of risk and benefit information may be conveyed, a promotional piece that 
510 
presents information on the benefits of the product but then communicates only its least serious risks, or 
511 
an inadequate set of its serious risks, will not have conveyed an accurate understanding of the product’s 
512 
relevant properties. 
513 
 
514 
C. 
CONSIDERATIONS OF FORMAT 
515 
 
516 
FDA also considers formatting factors when assessing whether a piece is false or misleading.  Format 
517 
includes the shape, size, and general layout of all portions of a print promotional piece, as 
 
well as the

general plan of organization, arrangement, and theme in non-print promotional pieces such as videos and 
519 
broadcast ads. 
520 
 
521 
To process information, a person must first pay attention to it.  Several factors contribute to whether 
522 
people will pay attention to information.  These factors also may help or hinder people’s understanding of 
523 
information once it has drawn their attention.  When evaluating whether a promotional piece 
524 
appropriately communicates risk information, FDA considers several formatting factors.38   Because these 
525 
factors apply to information processing in general, prescription drug and medical device manufacturers 
526 
should keep them in mind when developing promotional pieces.   
527 
  
528 
As a general matter, risk and benefit information should be comparably noticeable or conspicuous in 
529 
promotional pieces, and audiences should be able to read both risk and benefit information with similar 
530 
ease (e.g., comparably legible and understandable; see Section III.A.1 above).39  Manufacturers should 
531 
note that any one of the following formatting factors could make a piece false or misleading and that each 
532 
factor could interact with others to increase this problem or to create a false or misleading impression 
533 
when there might not be one if a factor were considered in isolation. 
534 
 
535 
1. 
Print Promotion 
536 
 
537 
The layout of a print promotional piece (generally, its plan, design, or arrangement) inf
 
luences readers’ 
538 
ability to pay attention to and process specific features of the piece.40  FDA considers the following 
539 
selected aspects of the layout of a print promotional piece when assessing the comparable prominence and 
540 
readability of risk and efficacy information.  This is not an exhaustive list; other issues, such as language 
541 
comprehension and the risk hierarchy, are covered in other sections. 
542 
 
543 
• 
Overall Location of Risk Information  
544 
 
545 
For a piece to be accurate and non-misleading, risk information should be included in the main part of a 
546 
piece.  If the omission of risk information in any part of a piece makes that part of the piece false or 
547 
misleading, the problem cannot be corrected simply by including the risk information in a separate part of 
548 
the piece.41   To be comparably prominent to benefit information, risk information should generally appear 
549 
in the same parts of the piece as the benefits.  
                                                     
38 See, e.g., 21 CFR 202.1(e)(7)(viii) for a list of implementing factors FDA takes into consideration when 
evaluating the balance between benefit and risk information in an ad.  See generally 21 CFR 202.1(e)(6)-(7).

the presence and location of a more complete discussion of such information elsewhere in the piece.  Id. However,

551 
Complete separation of benefit and risk information (e.g., presenting several pages of benefits before any 
552 
risks) is one example of a lack of appropriate prominence.42   FDA will also look to see that risk 
553 
information is not placed in such a way as to interfere with readers’ perceptions of the relative importance 
554 
or utility of the information.   
555 
 
556 
• 
Location of Risk Information within a Part of the Promotional Piece 
557 
 
558 
In addition to appearing with or near benefit presentations, risk information should appear as an integral 
559 
part of the piece, j ust as benefit information does.  For example, a prescription drug ad should not present 
560 
risks only on a brief summary page.   
561 
 
562 
Example 15: A product’s logo and a tagline are often used to signal the end of a piece.  Readers 
563 
may assume that any risk information placed below the logo and tagline is there only for liability 
564 
purposes or to fulfill a regulatory requirement and is unrelated to the main message, especially if 
565 
the information is presented in small type or otherwise lacking in emphasis.  
566 
 
567 
Example 16: A seven-page sales aid devotes the first six pages to effectiveness claims, which are 
568 
prominently presented with colorful graphics, abundant white space, and large, colorful headers.  
569 
Three of these pages also include a footnote referring readers to “Important Information on page 
570 
7.”  The seventh page summarizes some risk information from the PI in single-spaced paragraph 
571 
format without headers or other presentation elements to emphasize to the reader that it is 
572 
important risk information.  Such a presentation creates problems regarding the adequate 
573 
presentation of risk.  The important risk information about the drug should instead be integrated 
574 
into the piece and presented with similar prominence to the effectiveness claims. 
575 
 
576 
Similarly, problems can arise when parts of a print promotional piece appear so unrelated that the risks do 
577 
not look to be part of the piece.   
578 
 
579 
Example 17: Risk information is placed in a thin column along the side of an ad in a different font 
580 
and color scheme, so that the visuals and benefit information form a complete whole, separate 
581 
from the risk information.  This is not likely to be considered an adequate presentation of risk 
582 
information.   
583 
 
584 
• 
Font Size and Style 
585 
 
586 
Font size and type style are format factors that can affect the prominence and readability of information.43  
587 
FDA does not object to a presentation on the basis of minor differences in font size alone, depending on 
although the regulations allow for the “concise” presentation of such information, the nature and importance of this 
information should be accurately conveyed. For example, if a drug contains a boxed warning with information on 
the risk of elevations in potassium levels that can lead to life-threatening complications in some patients, a statement 
in a part of a promotional piece that “Drug X may increase your potassium levels; see Prescribing Information (PI) 
for more information” is not likely to convey to consumers or healthcare professionals the magnitude (i.e., life-
threatening nature) of the risk.

588 
other factors used to achieve emphasis (e.g., bolded lettering, bullets).  However, FDA may object to 
589 
substantial differences in font size or the presentation of risk information in a difficult to read font size, 
590 
irrespective of the font size of benefit information, because this may seriously reduce the ability to see or 
591 
comprehend the risk information. 
592 
 
593 
Even with identical risk and benefit font sizes, differences in type styles can render some information 
594 
easier to read than other information.44   To be comparably prominent and readable,  FDA recommends that 
595 
risk and benefit information be presented in type styles that are similar in the use of capitalization, serifs, 
596 
the weight of the type-face, the angle of the letters, the degree of flourishes and scripting, and other 
597 
typographical factors such as spacing (e.g., leading and kerning).45    
598 
 
599 
• 
Contrast 
600 
 
601 
Contrast between text and background should not highlight the benefit information more than the risk 
602 
information.   
603 
 
604 
Example 18: If benefit information in a piece is presented in white letters on a black background, 
605 
risk information should be presented with similar contrast.  If the piece presents risk information 
606 
in a way that would make it difficult to discern (e.g., using white letters on a light gray 
607 
background or gray letters on a black background), the presentation may be considered false or 
608 
misleading.    
609 
 
610 
Even if the background is a color designed to attract attention, the contrast influences the prominence of 
611 
the words once attention has been gained.  In fact, printing words in some attention-grabbing colors (e.g., 
612 
red) may make the words difficult to read.46  Similarly, the placement o f risk information over pictures or

other visual elements with multiple colors can cause this information or portions of this information to 
614 
lack prominence and be difficult to read.47   Furthermore, a print piece that superimposes risk information 
615 
over a visual image could compromise the accuracy of the piece as a whole by drawing attention away 
616 
from the risk information.48

• 
White Space 
619 
 
620 
Background space (often called white space) between and around letters can influence the prominence 
621 
and readability of text.49   Presenting benefit information in multiple paragraphs with double spaces 
622 
between each paragraph, while presenting risk inf
 
ormation in one block paragraph without spacing or 
623 
indentation could reduce the comparability of the risk and benefit presentations.  Moreover, if a 
624 
promotional piece uses headings, bullets, and other attention-getting symbols to emphasize product 
625 
benefits, FDA recommends that it use similar techniques to present product risks.50  
626

2. 
Non-Print Promotion 
628 
 
629 
Some print formatting issues also apply to non-print promotion such as videos, broadcast ads, and similar 
630 
audio and visual pieces. However, the unique features of non-print media add complexity.  As with print, 
631 
FDA considers factors such as location, proximity, type size, type style, and contrast when evaluating 
632 
these materials.  These factors are especially important with regard to text that is superimposed on other 
633 
images in videos or broadcast ads (SUPERs) and other visual components, such as graphics, within the 
634 
scene.  In non-print pieces, FDA also evaluates other formatting factors in addition to those described 
635 
above to determine whether a particular piece is considered false or misleading (e.g., audio co
 
mponents, 
636 
motion within the visual component, the juxtaposition of visual and audio components, and duration of 
637 
exposure).   
638

Textual Elements 
640 
 
641 
Prescription drug broadcast ads must present major product risks in the audio or audio and visual parts of 
642 
the ad.51   Thus, broadcast ads and videos often use SUPERs and other text to present risk-related 
643 
qualifying information.  When used to disclose risk, SUPERs can pose particular problems of readability, 
644 
comprehensibility, and proximity to benefit information.  For example, the FTC, which requires that

“[q]ualifying disclosures…be legible and understandable,” recognizes that, “in many circumstances 
646 
reasonable consumers do not read the entirety of an ad or are directed away from the importance of the 
647 
qualifying phrase by acts or statements of the seller.”52  FDA has similar concerns. 
648 
649 
FDA assesses the temporal location of SUPERs within a broadcast ad or video when evaluating whether 
650 
it is false or misleading.  If claims must be qualified to avoid misleading the audience, we recommend 
651 
that the qualifier be vocalized, presented through visual images, or placed in a prominent SUPER that 
652 
runs concurrently with the claim.53 If SUPERs do not appear close enough to the claim or risk 
653 
information requiring qualification, a misleading impression of the product may result.54 In addition, if 
654 
qualifying information is complex and requires more than one line of text, we recommend that 
655 
manufacturers use other means to convey this information. 
656 
657 
Other issues FDA considers important that manufacturers should keep in mind include the following: 
658 
659 
— SUPERs, if used, should be reasonably visible to a person under typical viewing conditions. 
660 
— All SUPERs should be on screen long enough to allow the audience to read and understand their 
661 
full content. 
662 
— Graphics that distract from the presentation of risk information, including from risk-related 
663 
SUPERs (e.g., busy scenes, frequent scene changes, vivid and compelling visuals55 and moving 
664 
camera angles) can misleadingly minimize the risks of the product being promoted by detracting 
665 
from the audience’s comprehension of the risk presentation. 
666 
— Competition from other SUPERs (e.g., presenting a SUPER related to a particular risk while 
667 
unrelated SUPERs are on the screen) hampers the audience’s ability to read and understand the 
668 
SUPERs and could compromise the communication of risk information and make a piece 
669 
misleading.56 
670 
— Factors such as font size, type style, and capitalization can also affect the readability of 
671 
SUPERs.57  Words presented in all upper case letters are more difficult to read than words 
672 
presented in upper and lower case letters.58

674 
• 
Contrast 
675 
676 
Contrast is an important visual factor59 that FDA considers when evaluating television ads and videos.60 
677 
As in print pieces, risk disclosures presented in SUPERs should be in a font color that reasonably 
678 
contrasts with the background visuals.  Because important non-benefit information is often conveyed by 
679 
SUPERs, any obstacle to the prominence and readability of this information, and thus to the audience’s 
680 
understanding of SUPERs, may result in a misleading risk presentation. 
681 
682 
• 
Dual Mode Considerations 
683 
684 
The interplay of visual and audio components in pieces such as television ads and videos introduces 
685 
unique factors FDA must consider when evaluating the adequacy of risk disclosure. The issues raised 
686 
above in Textual Elements about distracting visuals apply not only to the SUPER presentation but also to 
687 
the audio presentation of risks.61  If visuals in a broadcast ad distract the audience from the statement of a 
688 
product’s risks, the ad will not, as a whole, convey an accurate impression of the risks of the advertised 
689 
product. This distraction could be caused by factors including busy scenes, frequent scene changes, 
690 
moving camera angles, and even inherently compelling, vivid visuals.  In addition, the overall tone of the 
691 
ad or of specific background visuals can affect the comparable prominence of the risks, particularly if the 
692 
tone is contrary to the risk message. 
693 
694 
Example 20: A video or broadcast ad depicts a joyous or exhilarating moment, contains images of 
695 
people enjoying the benefits of the product, or includes otherwise compelling or distracting non­
696 
risk related images while major risks are communicated in a voiceover. The inconsistent tone or 
697 
images may be too distracting for the audience to listen to or process the risks, causing the video 
698 
or broadcast ad to communicate a false or misleading net impression of the product. 
699 
700 
• 
Audio Considerations 
701 
702 
FDA considers several audio-related factors when evaluating pieces such as sound recordings, videos, or 
703 
broadcast ads, including television, radio, and telephone communications. 
704 
705 
— The qualities of speech should be similar across benefit and risk information for these 
706 
components to be considered comparably prominent. 
707 
— A critical speech consideration is pacing. If risk information is considerably more difficult to 
708 
hear and process than benefit information because it is presented at a much faster pace, the piece 
709 
will not convey an accurate impression of the product. 
710 
— Markedly reducing volume or being less articulate when discussing risks compared to benefits 
711 
may hinder the audience’s comprehension of the risks. 
712 
— Background music should be comparable in volume and distraction potential during both benefit 
713 
and risk presentations.

IV. 
CONCLUSION 
717 
 
718 
The FDA’s regulation of prescription drug and medical device promotion to healthcare professionals and 
719 
consumers is a broad and complex topic.  A vast scientific body of knowledge is available regarding 
720 
human cognition, and FDA relies on this knowledge when evaluating promotional pieces and making 
721 
regulatory decisions about the presentation of benefit and risk information.  The Agency hopes that by 
722 
discussing the most relevant factors and by providing specific examples, manufacturers will gain a better 
723 
understanding of what they should consider as they develop the content and format of their promotional 
724 
communications. 
725 
 
726 
It is important to re-emphasize that, in addition to specific risk-related claims, FDA also considers the net 
727 
impression conveyed by all the elements of a piece.  For this reason, manufacturers should focus not just 
728 
on individual claims or presentations, but on the messages conveyed by the promotional piece as a whole.

ATTACHMENT: STATUTORY AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR 
731 
LABELING AND ADVERTISING 
732 
 
733 
FDA regulates the manufacture, sale, and distribution of drugs and devices in the United States under the 
734 
authority of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act).  This authority includes oversight of 
735 
labeling for all drugs and devices and of advertising for prescription drugs and restricted devices.  21 
736 
U.S.C. 352(a), (n), (q), & (r).  In regulating the labeling and advertising of drugs and devices, FDA 
737 
attends to the First Amendment. 
738 
 
739 
The Act defines label to mean “a display of written, printed, or graphic matter upon the immediate 
740 
container of any article . . . .”  21 U.S.C. 321(k).  According to FDA regulations (21 CFR 1.3(b)): “Label 
741 
means any display of written, printed, or graphic matter on the immediate container of any article, or any 
742 
such matter affixed to any consumer commodity or affixed to or appearing upon a package containing any 
743 
consumer commodity.”  The Act defines labeling to mean “all labels and other written, printed, or graphic 
744 
matter (1) upon any article or any of its containers or wrappers, or (2) accompanying such article.”  21 
745 
U.S.C. 321(m).  Similarly, FDA regulations (21 CFR 1.3(a)) provide that labeling includes “all written, 
746 
printed, or graphic matter accompanying an article at any time while such article is in interstate commerce 
747 
or held for sale after shipment or delivery in interstate commerce.” 
748 
 
749 
According to Kordel v. United States, 335 U.S. 345, 350 (1948), the language “accompanying such 
750 
article” in the “labeling” definition includes materials that supplement or explain an article, “in the 
 
751 
manner that a committee report of the Congress accompanies a bill.  No physical attachment one to the 
752 
other is necessary.  It is the textual relationship that is significant.”  FDA’s prescription drug advertising 
753 
regulations (21 CFR 202.1(l)(2)) thus provide as examples of labeling a wide variety of written, printed, 
754 
or graphic matter that bears a textual relationship with a product.  
755 
 
756 
FDA generally recognizes two types of labeling for drugs and devices:  FDA-required labeling and 
757 
promotional labeling.  Much FDA-required labeling is subject to FDA review and approval.  For 
758 
example, after drafting by the manufacturer, required labeling is reviewed and approved by FDA as part 
759 
of the new drug application (NDA), new animal drug application (NADA), biologics license application 
760 
(BLA) or premarket approval application (PMA) review (21 CFR 314.50(c)(2), 514.1(b)(3), 601.2(a), and 
761 
814.20(b)(10)).   
762 
 
763 
For devices that are not subject to premarket approval, but instead are subject to premarket notification 
764 
requirements or are exempt from premarket review, there is no agency review or approval of labeling, but 
765 
such devices remain subject to all of the requirements of applicable labeling regulations, including those 
766 
for adequate directions for use.  For a prescription drug or prescription device to be exempted from the 
767 
Act’s requirement of adequate directions for use (21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)), its FDA-required labeling must 
768 
contain, am
 
ong other information, information addressing product hazards and other risk information, as 
769 
specified in FDA regulations.62  
770 
 
771 
Promotional labeling is generally any labeling other than the FDA-required labeling that is devised for 
772 
promotion of the product.  Promotional labeling may include items such as “brochures, booklets, mailing 
 
773 
pieces, detailing pieces, file cards, bulletins, calendars, price lists, catalogs, house organs, letters, motion 
774 
picture films, film strips, lantern slides, sound recordings, exhibits, literature, and reprints and similar 
                                                     
62 21 CFR 201.100(d)(1), (3), 201.105(c)(1), & 801.109(d).

775 
pieces of printed, audio, or visual matter . . . .”63  The Act specifies that a drug or device shall be deemed 
776 
to be misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular.  21 U.S.C. 352(a).  The Act further 
777 
specifies that labeling or advertising may be considered misleading if it fails to reveal material facts about 
778 
the product being promoted, including facts about the consequences that can result from use of the 
779 
product as suggested in a promotional piece.  21 U.S.C. 321(n).  In addition, the Act specifies that a drug 
780 
or device will be deemed to be misbranded if any word, statement, or other information required under 
781 
the Act to appear on the label or labeling is not “prominently placed thereon with such conspicuousness 
782 
(as compared with other words, statements, designs, or devices, in the labeling) and in such terms as to 
783 
render it likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of 
784 
purchase and use.” 21 U.S.C. 352(c).  
785 
 
786 
Advertising64 for prescription drugs and restricted devices is also subject to requirements under the Act 
787 
for the disclosure of risk and other information.  Under section 502(n) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 352(n)) and 
788 
FDA’s implementing regulations (21 CFR Part 202), an ad for a prescription drug must include, in 
789 
addition to the product’s established name and quantitative composition, a “true statement” of information 
790 
in brief summary “relating to side effects, contraindi
 
cations and effectiveness” of the product with respect 
791 
to the use or uses that the message promotes.65   Advertisements for restricted devices must include “a 
792 
brief statement of the intended uses of the device and relevant warnings, precautions, side effects, and 
793 
contraindications . . . .”  21 U.S.C. 352(r)(2).  For prescription drug advertisements, FDA’s implementing 
794 
regulations specify that, among other things, the statutory requirement of a “true statement” is not 
795 
satisfied if an ad for a prescription drug product is false or misleading with respect to side effects, 
796 
contraindications or effectiveness or if it fails to reveal material facts about “consequences that may result 
797 
from the use of the drug as recommended or suggested in the advertisement.”  21 CFR 202.1(e)(5).  
798 
Similarly, the Act also specifies that restricted device advertisements must not be false or misleading (21 
799 
U.S.C. 352(q)(1)) and must reveal facts that are material about the product being advertised, including 
800 
facts about the consequences that can result from use of the product as suggested in an ad.  21 U.S.C. 
801 
321(n). 
802 
 
803 
The prescription drug regulations also specify that ads must present a fair balance between information 
804 
relating to risks and benefits, which is achieved when the treatment of risk and benefit information in a 
805 
promotional piece is comparably thorough and complete throughout the piece.  21 CFR 202.1(e)(5)(ii).  
806 
These regulations also provide illustrations of the factors FDA considers in determining whether 
807 
promotional pieces comply with the above requirements relating to risk disclosure.  Specifically, these 
808 
regulations identify twenty types of advertising communications that FDA considers “false, lacking in fair 
809 
balance, or otherwise misleading.”  21 CFR 202.1(e)(6).  These include, for example, representations or 
810 
suggestions that a drug is more effective or safer than has been demonstrated by substantial evidence or 
811 
substantial clinical experience, the use of pictures or graphics in a way that is misleading, and the 
 
812 
presentation of risk information “by means of a general term for a group” rather than disclosing specific 
                                                     
63 See, e.g.,  21 CFR 202.1(l)(2).  
64  The act does not define “advertising” or “advertisement.” According to FDA regulations (21 CFR 202.1(l)(1)), 
“Advertisements subject to section 502(n) of the act include advertisements in published journals, magazines, other 
periodicals, and newspapers, and advertisements broadcast through media such as radio, television, and telephone 
communication systems.”  
65  According to 21 CFR 202.1(e)(3)(iii), the information in brief s ummary relating to side effects and 
contraindications must disclose “each specific side effect and contraindication (which include side effects, warnings, 
precautions, and contraindications and include any such information under such headings as cautions
 
, special 
considerations, important notes, etc. . . .) contained in required, approved, or permitted labeling for the advertised 
drug dosage form(s)” (emphasis added).

813 
risks.  21 CFR 202.1(e)(6)(i), (xviii), & (xx).  Representing or suggesting that a drug product is “safer 
814 
than has been demonstrated by substantial evidence or substantial clinical experience” means obscuring 
815 
or failing to include the most serious risk information set forth in the drug's FDA-approved labeling, and 
 
816 
does not refer to a failure to include risk information that is not set forth in the drug's FDA-approved 
817 
labeling.  
818 
 
819 
In addition, these regulations identify thirteen additional types of advertising communications that “may 
820 
be false, lacking in fair balance, or otherwise misleading.”  21 CFR 202.1(e)(7).  These include, for 
821 
example, advertising communications that fail to “present information relating to side effects and 
822 
contraindications with a prominence and readability reasonably comparable with the presentation of 
823 
information relating to effectiveness of the drug.”  21 CFR 202.1(e)(7)(viii). 
824 
 
825 
Although the regulations discussed above were promulgated in the context of prescription drug 
826 
advertising, the guidance they provide on what FDA considers false or misleading in promotion has 
827 
broader applicability.  For example, promotional pieces 
 
that fail to present a balanced view of the risks 
828 
and benefits of a product are generally considered to be false or misleading and also generally fail to 
829 
reveal material facts about the product being promoted.  Because both labeling pieces for drugs and 
830
