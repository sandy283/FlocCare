its social and gender implications, and the possibilities offered by the 
various treatment modalities, should be considered as qualified to 
occupy this position.  The person should have a working knowledge of 
the psychological stress that would be experienced by potential 
patients, and should be able to counsel them to assuage their fears 
and anxiety and not to have unreasonable expectations from ART. A 
member of the staff of an ART Clinic/Bank who is not engaged in any

patients who have treatment involving mitochondrial 
donation techniques and any children that may be born 
following such treatment. 
35.6 
Anesthetist 
 
Anesthetist should have a MD/ DA in anesthesia .The role of the anesthetist in  a 
surrogacy clinic is to provide adequate comfort and pain relief  
to the patients 
during oocyte retrieval and embryo transfer procedures. The  
modality of the 
providing the same should depend on the patient cooperation. If  the 
patient 
is 
comfortable, conscious sedation should be preferred. The ideal anesthetist 
technique  should provide good surgical anesthetist with minimal side effects, a 
short recovery  
time, high rate of successful pregnancy, and shortest required 
duration of exposure.  
The key to anesthetist is to aim for pharmacological 
exposure of shortest duration  with minimal penetration to  
follicular 
fluid 
anesthetist are also expected to have  a broad general  
knowledge of all areas 
of medicine and surgery.

35.6.2 
The role of the anaesthetist in IVF is to provide adequate comfort and 
pain relief to the patients during oocyte retrieval and embryo transfer 
procedures. The modality of the providing the same should depend on 
the patient cooperation. If the patient is comfortable, conscious sedation 
should be preferred. The ideal anaesthetic technique for IVF should 
provide good surgical anaesthesia with minimal side effects, a short 
recovery time, high rate of successful pregnancy, and shortest required 
duration of exposure. The key to anaesthesia is to aim for 
pharmacological exposure of shortest duration with minimal penetration 
to follicular fluid Anaesthesiologists are also expected to have a broad 
general knowledge of all areas of medicine and surgery. 
35.6.3 
There should be an anesthetic chart in the patient’s notes, containing 
information such as:   
35.6.3.1 Known drug allergies 
35.6.3.2 Previous problems with an aesthetics or sedatives 
35.6.3.3 Airway assessment 
35.6.3.4 Whether the patient is taking any regular medication 
35.6.3.5 Any post-operative instructions (e.g., whether the patient will 
need antibiotics). 
35.6.4 
The Clinics should ensure that their procedures are suitable for the type 
of anesthetic or sedative provided. 
35.6.5 
The Clinics should ensure that only an appropriately qualified person 
provides an anaesthetic. If an anaesthetic is used at remote sites clinics 
should have a resuscitation team led by an Advanced Life Support 
provider. Where this is not the case, the anaesthetists should provide 
competency-based evidence of their ability to provide both advanced life 
support and the safe transport of a patient requiring multi-system

37.5 
A well-designed ART clinic / ART banks   should have a non-sterile and a 
strictly sterile area as detailed below. Some of the spaces mentioned below 
could be combined (that is, the same space may be used for more than one 
purpose) as long as such a step does not compromise the quality of service. 
However, the space provision for the sterile area cannot be combined with that 
for the non-sterile area and vice-versa.  
37.5.1 
Reception & Waiting area 
37.5.2 
Consulting Room/ Examination Room - A separate examination 
room with privacy for interviewing and examining male and female 
partners independently is essential. Adequate measures must be 
taken to ensure that history taking and examination are carried out 
in strict privacy, maintaining the dignity of the patients. In case a 
male doctor examines a female patient, there must always be a 
female attendant present. The room must be equipped with an 
examination table and gynaecological instruments for examining 
the female per vaginum, and an appropriate ultrasonographic 
machine. 
37.5.3 
Semen Collection Room: This must be a well-appointed room with 
privacy and an appropriate environment; it should be located in a 
secluded area close to the laboratory. Such a facility must be available 
in-house rather than having the patient collect the sample and bring it 
to the laboratory for analysis as, in the latter case, semen quality and 
identity is likely to be compromised. Procedures for collection of semen 
as described in the WHO Semen Analysis Manual must be followed 
with special reference to the type of container used; these containers 
must be sterile, maintained at body temperature and nontoxic. This 
room must have a washbasin with availability of soap and clean towels. 
The room must also have a toilet and must not be used for any other 
purpose.  
37.5.4 
Semen Processing Laboratory: There must be a separate room with a 
laminar air flow for semen processing, preferably close to the semen 
collection room. This laboratory must also have facilities for 
microscopic examination of post-coital test smears. Good Laboratory 
Practice (GLP) guidelines as defined internationally must be followed. 
Care must be taken for the safe disposal of biological waste and other 
materials (syringes, glass slides, etc.). Laboratory workers should be 
immunized against hepatitis B and tetanus. 


=== PAGE 22 ===

 
ART Rules 
Page 22 of 96 
 
37.5.5 
IUI Room: There must be a separate area/room with an appropriate 
table for Intra-Uterine Insemination (IUI). 
37.5.6 
General purpose clinical laboratory (in house/referral) with a Blood 
Collection Area - This can be inhouse/ referral. The ART Clinic/Bank 
must have ready access to laboratories that are able to carry out 
immunoassays of hormones (FSH, LH, Prolactin, hCG, TSH, Insulin, 
Estradiol, Progesterone, Testosterone and DHEA) and tests such as 
for HIV and Hepatitis B. Endocrine evaluation constitutes an essential 
diagnostic procedure to determine the cause of infertility. It is also 
necessary to estimate blood estradiol in samples taken from a woman 
undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, and have the result on 
the same day to determine the dose of drugs to be given for induction 
of ovulation. Accurate monitoring of endocrine response to controlled 
ovarian stimulation goes a long way in preventing ovarian 
hyperstimulation. 
37.5.7 
Microbiology and Histopathology - Another important facility in an ART 
clinic (or easily accessible to it) would be that of a microbiology 
laboratory that can carry out rapid tests for any infection, and a clinical 
chemistry laboratory. Facilities for carrying out histopathological studies 
on specimens obtained from the operation theatre would also be 
desirable. 
37.5.8 
Autoclave Room - A separate facility must be available for sterilizing 
and autoclaving all surgical items as well as some of those to be used 
in the in vitro culture laboratory. 
37.5.9 
Operation Theatre - This must be well equipped with facilities for 
carrying out surgical endoscopy and transvaginal ovum pick-up. The 
operation theatre must be equipped for emergency resuscitative 
procedures. We should have laparotomy set with suture material. 
There has to be an emergency tie-up with nearby hospital in case of 
complications. 
37.5.10 Embryo Transfer Room- This room must be in the sterile area and have 
an examination table on which the patient can be placed for carrying 
out the procedure and then rest undisturbed for a period of time. The 
operation theatre can be used for this purpose. The Operation Theatre 
and embryo transfer room should be directly connected with the 
embryology laboratory complex. 
37.5.11 The IVF/Culture Laboratory Complex - The embryology laboratory must 
have facilities for control of temperature and humidity and must have 
filtered air with an appropriate number of air exchanges per hour. Walls 
and floors must be composed of materials that can be easily washed 


=== PAGE 23 ===

 
ART Rules 
Page 23 of 96 
 
and disinfected; use of carpeting must be strictly avoided. The 
embryology laboratory must have the following: 
i) 
A laminar flow bench with a thermostatically controlled heating 
 plate 
ii) 
A stereo microscopeA routine high-powered binocular light 
microscope 
iii) 
A high-resolution inverted microscope with phase contrast or 
Hoffman optics, preferably with facilities for video recording 
iv) 
A micromanipulator (if ICSI is done) 
v) 
A CO2 incubator, preferably with a back up 
vi) 
A hot air oven 
vii) 
A laboratory centrifuge 
viii) 
Equipment for freezing embryos 
ix) 
Liquid nitrogen storage tanks 
x) 
A refrigerator 
xi) 
Appropriate steps need to be taken for the correct identification 
of gametes and embryos to avoid mix-ups. Preferably by using 
appropriate labelling system preferably with barcodes. 
xii) 
All material from the operation room, culture dishes and Falcon 
tubes for sperm collection (including lids), must bear the name of 
the patient. In the incubator, identified oocytes and sperm should 
be kept together on the same tray and double-checked.  
xiii) 
Pipettes used should be disposed off immediately after use. The 
embryology laboratory must have daily logbook in which all the 
day’s activities are recorded, including the performance of the 
equipment. 
37.5.12 Store Room- A well-stocked store for keeping essential stock of 
especially those items that have to be imported, precluding the need to 
be caught short in the middle of treatment, is required. Facilities must 
be available for storing sterile (media, needles, catheters, Petri dishes 
and such-like items) and non-sterile material under refrigerated and 
non-refrigerated conditions as appropriate. 
37.5.13 Record Room - Record keeping must be computerized so that data is 
accessible retrospectively for analysis or when called upon by the 
supervisory agency. The data must include essential details of the 
patient’s records, it must contain history of the cause of infertility as 
diagnosed earlier, results of new diagnosis if relevant, the treatment 
option best suited for the particular patient, the treatment carried out 
and the outcome of treatment, and follow-up if any. Any other 
noteworthy point such as possible adverse reaction to drugs, must be 
recorded. The software must have archival, retrieval and multivariate 


=== PAGE 24 ===

 
ART Rules 
Page 24 of 96 
 
statistical analysis capabilities.  
37.5.14 Fireproof cabinets can be used maintaining records and fire safety 
arrangements. 
37.5.15 Steps for Vermin Proofing - Adequate steps should be taken to make 
the whole clinic vermin proof, with suitable traps for preventing insects 
and other forms of unwanted creatures entering the clinic. This 
essential detail should be planned at an early stage because no 
pesticide can be used in a fully functional IVF clinic, as it could be toxic 
to the gametes and embryos. 
37.5.16 Maintenance & Quality Checks of the Laboratories: Each laboratory 
should maintain in writing, standard-operating manuals for the different 
procedures carried out in the laboratory. It should be ensured that there 
is no “mix up” of gametes or embryos. The donor identity number 
should be clearly labeled on all the tubes, dishes and pipettes 
containing the gametes. All pipettes should be immediately discarded 
after use. Laminar flow hoods, laboratory tables, incubators and other 
areas where sterility is required must be periodically checked for 
microbial contamination using standard techniques, and a record of 
such checks must be kept. A logbook should be maintained which 
records the temperature, carbon dioxide content and humidity of the 
incubators and the manometer readings of the laminar air flow. All 
instruments must be calibrated periodically (at least once every year) 
and a record of such calibration maintained. 
37.5.17 Quality of consumables used in the laboratory: All disposable plastic 
ware must be procured from reliable sources after ensuring that they 
are not toxic. Culture media used for processing gametes should be 
preferably procured from reliable manufacturers. Each batch of culture 
medium needs to be tested for sterility, endotoxins, osmolality and pH. 
The embryologist should know the composition of the media that are 
being used. Most media are supplemented with serum; they should, 
therefore, be tested for antibodies to HIV 1 and 2, Hepatitis B Surface 
Antigen and Hepatitis C RNA. 
37.5.18 Back-up Facility- There should be no interruption in power supply to the 
incubator and to other essential services of the ART Bank. Given the 
power supply situation in India, it is, therefore, imperative that a power 
back up in the form of UPS systems and/or a captive power generation 
system is available in ART Bank.

FORM -12 
Consent Form to be Signed by the Couple/Woman 
 
I/We have requested the clinic…………………………………………..………………………… 
…………………………………………………………………..…………. (name &address of 
clinic) to provide us with treatment services to help us bear a child. 
 
We understand and accept (as applicable) that: 
 
1. 
The drugs that are used to stimulate the ovaries for ovulation induction have 
temporary side- effects like nausea, headaches and abdominal bloating.  Only in a 
small proportion of cases, a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation occurs where 
there is an exaggerated ovarian response.  Such cases can be identified ahead of 
time but only to a limited extent.  Further, at times the ovarian response is poor or 
absent in spite of using a high dose of drugs.  Under these circumstances, the 
treatment cycle will be cancelled.  
2. 
There is no guarantee that: 
i) 
The oocytes will be retrieved in all cases. 
ii) 
The oocytes will be fertilized. 
iii) 
Even if there were fertilization, the resulting embryos would be of suitable 
quality to be transferred. 
 
All these unforeseen situations will result in the cancellation of any treatment.  
3. 
I/ We fully consent to these procedures and to the administration of such drugs and 
anesthetics as may be necessary. We also consent to any other operative measures, 
which may be found to be necessary in the course of the treatment. 
4. 
I/ We have been told of the risks of ultrasound directed follicle aspiration. 
5. 
I/ We are aware that we are free to withdraw or vary the terms of this consent until 
the gametes and/ or embryos have been used in accordance with my/ our wishes. I 
am aware that this will have to be a written request 
6. 
There is no certainty that a pregnancy will result from these procedures even in 
cases where good quality embryos are transferred. 
7. 
If a clinical pregnancy does result from assisted conception treatment, I/ we 
understand there is an accepted risk of multiple pregnancy, an ectopic pregnancy or 
of a miscarriage. I/ We understand that as in natural conception, there is a small risk 
of fetal abnormality. 
8. 
Medical and scientific staff can give no assurance that any pregnancy will result in 
the delivery of a normal living child.  
9.       The uncertainty of the outcome of the procedure has been fully explained to me/ us. 
I/ We fully understand the risks of treatment including; 
i) it is not possible to guarantee that a follicle will develop in a given cycle and that 
occasionally cycles have to be abandoned before egg retrieval. 


=== PAGE 67 ===

 
ART Rules 
 
Page 67 of 96 
 
ii) there is a risk that spontaneous ovulation can happen prior to/or during the egg 
retreival. 
iii) an egg is not always recovered from a follicle at the time of egg retrieval. 
iv) any eggs may be collected and fertilization of any collected eggs will occur  
v) is a risk that the cycle will be abandoned before Embryo Transfer if there is failure 
of fertilization, abnormal fertilization or failure of the embryo to cleave (divide)  
vi) a pregnancy may result from treatment. 
vii) treatment may be abandoned at any time if there are problems in the laboratory 
or with the culture system 
10. 
I/ We have been fully informed of all that is involved with the IVF technique and have 
been advised regarding the chances of success, the possibility of multiple pregnancy 
occurring and other possible complications of treatment by the doctor. I/ We have 
also received information relating to treatment by these techniques in order to assist 
us to become more fully aware of what is involved.

I understand that there will be no direct or indirect contact between me and the recipient, 
and my personal identity will not be disclosed to the recipient or to the child born through 
the use of my gamete. 
 
I understand that I shall have no rights whatsoever on the resulting offspring and vice versa. 
 
I understand that the method of treatment may include: 
 
1. 
Stimulating my ovaries for multifollicular development. 
2. 
The recovery of one or more of my eggs under ultrasound-guidance or by 
laparoscopy under sedation or general anesthesia. 
3. 
The fertilization of my oocytes with recipient’s husband’s or donor sperm and 
transferring the resulting embryo into the recipient.  
 
(If applicable) My husband has agreed to the donation of my oocyte.  (Strike off if not 
applicable.) 
 
I understand and accept that the drugs that are used to stimulate the ovaries to raise 
oocytes have temporary side-effects like nausea, headaches and abdominal bloating. Only 
in a small proportion of cases, a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation occurs where 
there is an exaggerated ovarian response.  Such cases can be identified ahead of time but 
only to a limited extent.  Further, at times the ovarian response is poor or absent in spite of 
using a high dose of drugs.  Under these circumstances, the treatment cycle will be 
cancelled.
