Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions                                                                                                  non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have
• KRAZATI can cause severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions.                                                                      received at least one prior systemic therapy.
• Monitor and manage patients using supportive care, including antidiarrheals, antiemetics, or
    fluid replacement, as indicated. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue                                        This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective
    KRAZATI based on severity.                                                                                                      response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR). Continued approval for this
                                                                                                                                    indication may be contingent upon verification and description of a clinical
QTc Interval Prolongation                                                                                                           benefit in a confirmatory trial(s).
• KRAZATI can cause QTc interval prolongation, which can increase the risk for ventricular
    tachyarrhythmias (eg, torsades de pointes) or sudden death.
• Avoid concomitant use of KRAZATI with other products with a known potential to prolong the
    QTc interval. Avoid use of KRAZATI in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in
    patients with concurrent QTc prolongation.
• Monitor ECGs and electrolytes prior to starting KRAZATI, during concomitant use, and as
    clinically indicated in patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, electrolyte
    abnormalities, and in patients who are taking medications that are known to prolong the QT
    interval. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue KRAZATI, depending on
    severity.
Hepatotoxicity
• KRAZATI can cause hepatotoxicity, which may lead to drug-induced liver injury and
    hepatitis.
• Monitor liver laboratory tests (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) prior to
    the start of KRAZATI, and monthly for 3 months, then every 3 months or as clinically
    indicated, with more frequent testing in patients who develop transaminase elevations.
    Reduce the dose, withhold, or permanently discontinue KRAZATI based on severity.
Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis
• KRAZATI can cause interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis, which can be fatal.
• Monitor patients for new or worsening respiratory symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis
    (eg, dyspnea, cough, fever) during treatment with KRAZATI.
• Withhold KRAZATI in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis and permanently
    discontinue KRAZATI if no other potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis are identified.
ADVERSE REACTIONS
• The most common adverse reactions in NSCLC patients (≥20%) are diarrhea, nausea,
    fatigue, vomiting, musculoskeletal pain, hepatotoxicity, renal impairment, dyspnea, edema,
    decreased appetite, cough, pneumonia, dizziness, constipation, abdominal pain, and QTc
    interval prolongation.
USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
Females and Males of Reproductive Potential
• Infertility: Based on findings from animal studies, KRAZATI may impair fertility in females
    and males of reproductive potential.

**Description of Visual Elements:**

1.  **Waterfall Plot (Tumor Response Chart):** This is the prominent visual element in the center of the page.
    *   **Purpose:** It illustrates the best percentage change from baseline in tumor size for individual patients in the Registrational Phase 2 Cohort treated with KRAZATI.
    *   **X-axis:** Represents individual patients, with each vertical bar corresponding to one patient.
    *   **Y-axis:** Labeled "PERCENT CHANGE FROM BASELINE," with values ranging from -100 to 40. Values below 0 indicate tumor shrinkage, and values above 0 indicate tumor growth.
    *   **Bars:** There are numerous thin vertical bars. Most bars extend downwards from the 0% line, showing tumor shrinkage in the majority of patients. A green shaded box highlights the area below -50%, indicating that "75% OF RESPONDERS ACHIEVED A >50% RESPONSE³³". Some bars extend upwards, indicating tumor growth.
    *   **Labels:** "PATIENTS WITH MEASURABLE DISEASE AT BASELINE" is displayed below the series of bars.
    *   **Interactive Buttons (Simulated):** On the right side of the chart, there are four circular buttons labeled: "Stable Disease," "Partial Response," "Complete Response," and "Progressive Disease." These are accompanied by the text "Click a button to see the best tumor response," suggesting an interactive feature where clicking these buttons would likely highlight or filter specific bars on the chart corresponding to those response types.
