Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions                                                                                                locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as determined
•   KRAZATI can cause severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions.                                                                    by an FDA-approved test, who have received at least one prior systemic therapy.
•   Monitor and manage patients using supportive care, including antidiarrheals, antiemetics, or
    fluid replacement, as indicated. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue                                        This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective
    KRAZATI based on severity.                                                                                                        response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR). Continued approval for this

QTc Interval Prolongation                                                                                                             benefit in a confirmatory trial(s).
•   KRAZATI can cause QTc interval prolongation, which can increase the risk for ventricular
    tachyarrhythmias (eg, torsades de pointes) or sudden death.
•   Avoid concomitant use of KRAZATI with other products with a known potential to prolong the
    QTc interval. Avoid use of KRAZATI in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in
    patients with concurrent QTc prolongation.
•   Monitor ECGs and electrolytes prior to starting KRAZATI, during concomitant use, and as
    clinically indicated in patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, electrolyte
    abnormalities, and in patients who are taking medications that are known to prolong the QT
    interval. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue KRAZATI, depending on
    severity.
Hepatotoxicity
•   KRAZATI can cause hepatotoxicity, which may lead to drug-induced liver injury and
    hepatitis.
•   Monitor liver laboratory tests (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) prior to
    the start of KRAZATI, and monthly for 3 months or as clinically indicated, with more
    frequent testing in patients who develop transaminase elevations. Reduce the dose,
    withhold, or permanently discontinue KRAZATI based on severity.
Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis
•   KRAZATI can cause interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis, which can be fatal.
•   Monitor patients for new or worsening respiratory symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis
    (eg, dyspnea, cough, fever) during treatment with KRAZATI.
•   Withhold KRAZATI in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis and permanently
    discontinue KRAZATI if no other potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis are identified.
ADVERSE REACTIONS
•   The most common adverse reactions in NSCLC patients (≥20%) are diarrhea, nausea,
    vomiting, musculoskeletal pain, hepatotoxicity, fatigue, cough, pneumonia, decreased
    appetite, constipation, abdominal pain, and QTc interval prolongation.
USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
Females and Males of Reproductive Potential
•   Infertility: Based on findings from animal studies, KRAZATI may impair fertility in females
    and males of reproductive potential.
