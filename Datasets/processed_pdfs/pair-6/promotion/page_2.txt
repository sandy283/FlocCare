**WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS**                                                                      KRAZATI is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with KRAS G12C-mutated
**Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions**                                                            non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have
• KRAZATI can cause severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions.                                    received at least one prior systemic therapy.
• Monitor and manage patients using supportive care, including antidiarrheals, antiemetics, or    This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective
  fluid replacement, as indicated. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue          response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR). Continued approval for this
  KRAZATI based on severity.                                                                      indication may be contingent upon verification and description of a clinical
                                                                                                  benefit in a confirmatory trial(s).
**QTc Interval Prolongation**
• KRAZATI can cause QTc interval prolongation, which can increase the risk for ventricular
  tachyarrhythmias (eg, torsades de pointes) or sudden death.
• Avoid concomitant use of KRAZATI with other products with a known potential to prolong the
  QTc interval. Avoid use of KRAZATI in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in
  patients with concurrent QTc prolongation.
• Monitor ECGs and electrolytes prior to starting KRAZATI, during concomitant use, and as
  clinically indicated in patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, electrolyte
  abnormalities, and in patients who are taking medications that are known to prolong the QT
  interval. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue KRAZATI, depending on
  severity.

**Hepatotoxicity**
• KRAZATI can cause hepatotoxicity, which may lead to drug-induced liver injury and
  hepatitis.
• Monitor liver laboratory tests (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) prior to
  the start of KRAZATI, and monthly for 3 months or as clinically indicated, with more
  frequent testing in patients who develop transaminase elevations. Reduce the dose,
  withhold, or permanently discontinue KRAZATI based on severity.

**Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis**
• KRAZATI can cause interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis, which can be fatal.
• Monitor patients for new or worsening respiratory symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis
  (eg, dyspnea, cough, fever) during treatment with KRAZATI.
• Withhold KRAZATI in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis and permanently
  discontinue KRAZATI if no other potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis are identified.

**ADVERSE REACTIONS**
• The most common adverse reactions in NSCLC patients (≥20%) are diarrhea, nausea,
  fatigue, vomiting, musculoskeletal pain, hepatotoxicity, renal impairment, dyspnea, edema,
  decreased appetite, cough, pneumonia, dizziness, constipation, abdominal pain, and QTc
  interval prolongation.

**USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS**
**Females and Males of Reproductive Potential**
• Infertility: Based on findings from animal studies, KRAZATI may impair fertility in females
  and males of reproductive potential.
