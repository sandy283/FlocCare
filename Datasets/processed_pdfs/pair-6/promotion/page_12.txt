SAFETY

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions
*   KRAZATI can cause severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions.
*   Monitor and manage patients using supportive care, including antidiarrheals, antiemetics, or
    fluid replacement, as indicated. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue
    KRAZATI based on severity.

QTc Interval Prolongation
*   KRAZATI can cause QTc interval prolongation, which can increase the risk for ventricular
    tachyarrhythmias (eg, torsades de pointes) or sudden death.
*   Avoid concomitant use of KRAZATI with other products with a known potential to prolong the
    QTc interval. Avoid use of KRAZATI in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in
    patients with concurrent QTc prolongation.
*   Monitor ECGs and electrolytes prior to starting KRAZATI, during concomitant use, and as
    clinically indicated in patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, electrolyte
    abnormalities, and in patients who are taking medications that are known to prolong the QT
    interval. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue KRAZATI, depending on
    severity.

Hepatotoxicity
*   KRAZATI can cause hepatotoxicity, which may lead to drug-induced liver injury and
    hepatitis.
*   Monitor liver laboratory tests (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) prior to
    the start of KRAZATI, and monthly for 3 months or as clinically indicated, with more
    frequent testing in patients who develop transaminase elevations. Reduce the dose,
    withhold, or permanently discontinue KRAZATI based on severity.

Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis
*   KRAZATI can cause interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis, which can be fatal.
*   Monitor patients for new or worsening respiratory symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis
    (eg, dyspnea, cough, fever) during treatment with KRAZATI.
*   Withhold KRAZATI in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis and permanently
    discontinue KRAZATI if no other potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis are identified.

ADVERSE REACTIONS
*   The most common adverse reactions in NSCLC patients (≥20%) are diarrhea, nausea,
    vomiting, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, cough, decreased appetite, constipation, abdominal pain, and QTc
    interval prolongation.

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
Females and Males of Reproductive Potential
*   Infertility: Based on findings from animal studies, KRAZATI may impair fertility in females
    and males of reproductive potential.

Please see Full Prescribing Information.

INDICATION
KRAZATI is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with KRAS G12C-mutated
locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as determined
by an FDA-approved test, who have received at least one prior systemic therapy.

This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective
response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR). Continued approval for this
indication may be contingent upon verification and description of a clinical
benefit in a confirmatory trial(s).

**Visual Elements Description:**

1.  **Header/Navigation Bar:** At the top of the page, there's a horizontal navigation bar. On the left, a logo for "KRAZATI® (adagrasib) 200 mg TABLETS" is displayed. To the right, navigation links include "KRAS G12C in NSCLC", "KRAZATI MOA", "Clinical Data", "Dosage", "Resources & Support", and a blue button labeled "STAY CONNECTED". Further right, a small box lists "IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION", "PRESCRIBING INFORMATION", "REFERENCES", and "VISIT PATIENT SITE". Below the main logo, there's a green section with "CURRENT INDICATION > NSCLC" on the left, and "SWITCH INDICATION" with "OTHER" and "NSCLC" options on the right. Below this, another dark gray bar shows navigation options: "ORR", "DCR", "Intracranial ORR", "OS", "PFS", and "DOR Descriptive analysis".

2.  **Kaplan-Meier Plot (Survival Curve):** This is the prominent visual element in the center of the page.
    *   **Title:** "DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS MEDIAN DOR IN PATIENTS TAKING KRAZATI: 12.5 MONTHS³²"
    *   **Type:** It is a Kaplan-Meier curve, commonly used to display survival probability over time.
    *   **Y-axis:** Labeled "Survival Probability", ranging from 0 to 1.0 in increments of 0.2.
    *   **X-axis:** Labeled "Duration of Response (months)", ranging from 0 to 24 in increments of 3 months.
    *   **Curve:** A stepped line graph trending downwards, starting at a survival probability of 1.0 at 0 months and decreasing over time, indicating a reduction in the probability of response duration continuing. Small vertical tick marks on the curve indicate censored data points. The curve ends around the 21-month mark on the graph.
    *   **Key Data Points:**
        *   "12.5 MONTHS" is highlighted prominently in green, with accompanying text "(n=55; 95% CI: 7.0-15.6)".
        *   "Data cutoff: October 15, 2021" is noted below the 12.5 MONTHS value.
        *   A horizontal dashed line extends from the y-axis (around 0.5 survival probability) to intersect the curve, and a vertical dashed line drops from this intersection to the x-axis, visually representing the median duration of response (12.5 months).
    *   **Table Below Graph:** A table shows the "No. at risk" below the x-axis for various time points: 55 at 0 months, 48 at 3 months, 35 at 6 months, 24 at 9 months, 14 at 12 months, 8 at 15 months, 3 at 18 months, and 0 at 21 and 24 months.
    *   **Legend/Footnote:** "CI=confidence interval; DOR=duration of response." is located below the table.
    *   A "SAFETY →" button is visible to the right of the graph, below the 12.5 MONTHS text.

3.  **Footer:** At the bottom, the "Bristol Myers Squibb®" logo is displayed. Below it, the text reads "© 2024 Mirati Therapeutics, Inc., a Bristol Myers Squibb company." and "KRAZATI® and the related logo are registered trademarks of Mirati Therapeutics, Inc.". To the right, there are links for "LEGAL NOTICE", "PRIVACY POLICY", and "YOUR PRIVACY CHOICES" with a checkbox icon. The last line states "This website is intended for U.S. residents 18 years of age or older." and "US-KRA-22-00152 V8 8/24".
