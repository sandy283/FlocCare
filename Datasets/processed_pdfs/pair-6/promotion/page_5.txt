IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions
  • KRAZATI can cause severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions.
  • Monitor and manage patients using supportive care, including antidiarrheals, antiemetics, or
    fluid replacement, as indicated. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue
    KRAZATI based on severity.
QTc Interval Prolongation
  • KRAZATI can cause QTc interval prolongation, which can increase the risk for ventricular
    tachyarrhythmias (eg, torsades de pointes) or sudden death.
  • Avoid concomitant use of KRAZATI with other products with a known potential to prolong the
    QTc interval. Avoid use of KRAZATI in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in
    patients with concurrent QTc prolongation.
  • Monitor ECGs and electrolytes prior to starting KRAZATI, during concomitant use, and as
    clinically indicated in patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, electrolyte
    abnormalities, and in patients who are taking medications that are known to prolong the QT
    interval. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue KRAZATI, depending on
    severity.
Hepatotoxicity
  • KRAZATI can cause hepatotoxicity, which may lead to drug-induced liver injury and
    hepatitis.
  • Monitor liver laboratory tests (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) prior to
    the start of KRAZATI, and monthly for 3 months or as clinically indicated, with more
    frequent testing in patients who develop transaminase elevations. Reduce the dose,
    whithhold, or permanently discontinue KRAZATI based on severity.
Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis
  • KRAZATI can cause interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis, which can be fatal.
  • Monitor patients for new or worsening respiratory symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis
    (eg, dyspnea, cough, fever) during treatment with KRAZATI.
  • Withhold KRAZATI in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis and permanently
    discontinue KRAZATI if no other potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis are identified.
ADVERSE REACTIONS
  • The most common adverse reactions in NSCLC patients (≥20%) are diarrhea, nausea,
    fatigue, vomiting, musculoskeletal pain, hepatotoxicity, decreased appetite, cough, pneumonia,
    dizziness, constipation, abdominal pain, and QTc interval prolongation.
USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
Females and Males of Reproductive Potential
  • Infertility: Based on findings from animal studies, KRAZATI may impair fertility in females
    and males of reproductive potential.
Please see Full Prescribing Information.

INDICATION
KRAZATI is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with KRAS G12C-mutated
locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as determined
by an FDA-approved test, who have received at least one prior systemic therapy.

This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective
response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR). Continued approval for this
indication may be contingent upon verification and description of a clinical
benefit in a confirmatory trial(s).

**Visual Element Description:**

**Bar Chart (Waterfall Plot):**
This page features a prominent bar chart, commonly known as a waterfall plot, titled "PATIENTS WITH MEASURABLE DISEASE AT BASELINE".

*   **Purpose:** The chart visually represents the individual tumor responses (shrinkage or growth) experienced by patients in the registrational Phase 2 cohort who were taking KRAZATI for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
*   **Axes:**
    *   The vertical (Y) axis is labeled "PERCENT CHANGE FROM BASELINE" and ranges from -100 to 40, with 0 representing no change in tumor size. Negative values indicate tumor shrinkage, and positive values indicate tumor growth.
    *   The horizontal (X) axis represents individual patients, with each vertical bar corresponding to one patient's best tumor response.
*   **Content:** The chart displays a series of narrow, vertical bars. The vast majority of these bars are green and extend downwards from the 0% baseline, illustrating tumor shrinkage. The length of each bar below the baseline corresponds to the magnitude of shrinkage. A smaller number of bars are shorter, indicating less shrinkage or even slight growth (extending slightly above the 0% line).
*   **Key Highlight:** An overlayed green box with white text is positioned over the chart, stating: "75% OF RESPONDERS ACHIEVED A >50% RESPONSE³³". This highlights a significant finding: a large proportion of patients who responded to treatment achieved a substantial reduction in tumor size (more than 50% shrinkage).
*   **Context:** The chart supports the claim "DCR IN PATIENTS TAKING KRAZATI: 80% (n=112; 95% CI: 70.8-86.5)³*", visually demonstrating the depth and breadth of tumor control achieved by KRAZATI. The accompanying text notes that 80% of patients experienced tumor shrinkage of any magnitude, and the median follow-up time was 12.9 months.
