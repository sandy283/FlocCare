Post hoc subgroup analysis of KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC patients
with stable, adequately treated brain metastases (n=42).*
  * Median follow-up time was 15.4 months.
  * Data cutoff: December 31, 2021

INTRACRANIAL DCR IN PATIENTS WITH
BRAIN METASTASES: **85%** (n=33; 95% CI: 68-95)¹

NCCN Guidelines for CNS
cancers recommend
adagrasib (KRAZATI) as a
systemic therapy option
for patients with KRAS
G12C-mutated advanced
NSCLC with brain
metastases (Category
2A).³²

Patients identified by BICR as having brain metastases at baseline were evaluated by mRANO-BM;
33 were considered radiographically evaluable (ie, with ≥1 on-study scan).†
INTRACRANIAL ORR AND DCR CANNOT BE ATTRIBUTED TO KRAZATI ALONE, GIVEN BRAIN METASTASES WERE PREVIOUSLY
TREATED, SOME WITH RECENT PRIOR RADIATION. THESE RESULTS SHOULD BE INTERPRETED WITH CAUTION.

*Patients were eligible if brain metastases were adequately treated (eg, with radiation, surgery) ≥4 weeks prior to enrollment without the use of corticosteroids or were on a stable or decreasing dose of
≤10 mg daily prednisone (or equivalent).
†Modifications to RANO-BM included ≥5 mm lesions, corticosteroid use, and neurologically stable patients. BICR=blinded independent central review; CI=confidence interval; CNS=central nervous system; DCR=disease control rate; ECOG PS=Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status; mRANO-BM=modified
Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Brain Metastases; NCCN=National Comprehensive Cancer Network; NSCLC=non-small cell lung cancer; ORR=objective response rate.

**WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS**

**Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions**
*   KRAZATI can cause severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions.
*   Monitor and manage patients using supportive care, including antidiarrheals, antiemetics, or
    fluid replacement, as indicated. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue
    KRAZATI based on severity.

**QTc Interval Prolongation**
*   KRAZATI can cause QTc interval prolongation, which can increase the risk for ventricular
    tachyarrhythmias (eg, torsades de pointes) or sudden death.
*   Avoid concomitant use of KRAZATI with other products with a known potential to prolong the
    QTc interval. Avoid use of KRAZATI in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in
    patients who are taking medications that are known to prolong the QT interval.
*   Monitor ECGs and electrolytes prior to starting KRAZATI, during concomitant use, and as
    clinically indicated. Correct hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypercalcemia prior to and
    during KRAZATI treatment. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue KRAZATI,
    depending on severity.

**Hepatotoxicity**
*   KRAZATI can cause hepatotoxicity, which may lead to drug-induced liver injury and
    hepatitis.
*   Monitor liver laboratory tests (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) prior to
    the start of KRAZATI, and monthly for 3 months or as clinically indicated, with more
    frequent testing in patients who develop transaminase elevations. Reduce the dose,
    withhold, or permanently discontinue KRAZATI based on severity.

**Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis**
*   KRAZATI can cause interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis, which can be fatal.
*   Monitor patients for new or worsening respiratory symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis
    (eg, dyspnea, cough, fever) during treatment with KRAZATI.
*   Withhold KRAZATI in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis and permanently
    discontinue KRAZATI if no other potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis are identified.

**ADVERSE REACTIONS**
*   The most common adverse reactions in NSCLC patients (≥20%) are diarrhea, nausea,
    vomiting, musculoskeletal pain, hepatotoxicity, renal impairment, dyspnea, edema,
    decreased appetite, cough, pneumonia, dizziness, constipation, abdominal pain, and QTc
    interval prolongation.

**USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS**
**Females and Males of Reproductive Potential**
*   Infertility: Based on findings from animal studies, KRAZATI may impair fertility in females
    and males of reproductive potential.

Please see Full Prescribing Information.

**INDICATION**

KRAZATI is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with KRAS G12C-mutated
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have
received at least one prior systemic therapy.

This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective
response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR). Continued approval for this
indication may be contingent upon verification and description of a clinical
benefit in a confirmatory trial(s).
