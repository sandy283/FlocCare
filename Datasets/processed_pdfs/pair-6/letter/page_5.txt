you have data to support this claim, please submit them to FDA for review.

The “Intracranial ORR” navigation bar item on the “KRYSTAL-1 Efficacy” webpage includes
the claims, “33% INTRACRANIAL ORR IN PATIENTS WITH STABLE, ADEQUATELY
TREATED BRAIN METASTASES” and, “INTRACRANIAL DCR IN PATIENTS WITH BRAIN
METASTASES: 85% (n=33; 95% CI: 68-95).” As a reference for these claims, you cite
Janne et al. (2022)⁶ and Spira et al. (2022).¹⁰ These claims are misleading because they
imply that Krazati is effective in treating brain metastases even though such an effect is not
established by this post hoc analysis. In a clinical trial designed to specifically evaluate brain
metastases using the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Brain Metastases (RANO
BM) criteria,¹¹ previously treated target lesions would have documentation of how each
lesion was previously treated (e.g., stereotactic radiosurgery, whole brain radiotherapy,
surgical resection); however, this information was not collected in this single-arm cohort. It is
known only that the majority of patients (27 of the 33 evaluable patients) included in this post-
hoc subgroup analysis were previously treated with radiation therapy for brain metastases.
Therefore, this post-hoc analysis did not establish that improvement in intracranial ORR is
attributable to treatment with Krazati; these results may instead represent the effects of
radiation therapy. In addition to the confounding factors affecting the interpretability of
intracranial ORR in the trial, intracranial DCR is not interpretable as an effect of treatment
with Krazati due to the limitations described above regarding the single-arm design of the
trial.

We acknowledge that the text, “POST HOC ANALYSIS” appears under the “Intracranial
ORR” navigation bar item header when you click to view the item, as well as the following
statements that appear at the bottom of the page (underlined emphasis added):
“INTRACRANIAL ORR AND DCR CANNOT BE ATTRIBUTED TO KRAZATI ALONE GIVEN
BRAIN METASTASES WERE PREVIOUSLY TREATED, SOME WITH RECENT PRIOR
RADIATION. THESE RESULTS SHOULD BE INTERPRETED WITH CAUTION.” However,
these statements are not sufficient to mitigate the overall misleading impression created by
the inclusion of this presentation. In fact, the statements suggest that intracranial ORR and
DCR can be attributed, in part, to an effect of Krazati when these data cannot be interpreted
at all as an effect of Krazati.

**Conclusion and Requested Action**

For the reasons discussed above, the website misbrands Krazati within the meaning of the
FD&C Act and makes its distribution violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(a), (n); 321(n); 331(a). See 21
CFR 202.1(e)(5).

This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you with an opportunity to address them.
OPDP requests that Mirati Therapeutics Inc., a Bristol Myers Squibb Co. cease any violations
of the FD&C Act. Please submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from
the date of receipt, addressing the concerns described in this letter, listing all promotional
