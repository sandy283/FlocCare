RE: NDA 216340
    KRAZATI™ (adagrasib) tablets, for oral use
    MA 166

Dear Nicole Van de Vaarst:

The Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (OPDP) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has reviewed the promotional communication, the “KRYSTAL-1 Efficacy” webpage¹ on
the Healthcare Provider Branded Website (US-KRA-22-00152) (website) for KRAZATI™
(adagrasib) tablets, for oral use submitted by Mirati Therapeutics Inc., a Bristol Myers Squibb
Co. under cover of Form FDA 2253. The FDA Bad Ad Program also received multiple
complaints regarding the website.

The website makes false or misleading claims and representations about the benefits of
Krazati. Thus, the website misbrands Krazati within the meaning of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and makes its distribution violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(a), (n);
321(n); 331(a). See 21 CFR 202.1(e)(5). These violations are particularly concerning
because the promotional communication makes misleading representations about the
efficacy of Krazati in patients with KRAS G12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic non-
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Metastatic NSCLC is an incurable condition with a 5-year
survival rate of less than 10%, and lung cancer is a serious public health concern and
treatment for this condition involves serious risks. Lung cancer is by far the leading cause of
cancer death in the United States, accounting for about 1 in 5 of all cancer deaths.²

Background

Below are the indication and summary of the most serious and most common risks
associated with the use of Krazati.³ According to the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section of

¹ The “KRYSTAL-1 Efficacy” webpage is accessed from the “Efficacy” menu item under the “Clinical Data” sub-
