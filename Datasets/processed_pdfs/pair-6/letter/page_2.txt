the FDA-approved Prescribing Information (PI) (in pertinent part):

       KRAZATI is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with *KRAS G12C*-mutated
       locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, as determined by an FDA approved test, who
       have received at least one prior systemic therapy.

       This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective response
       rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR). Continued approval for this indication
       may be contingent upon verification and description of a clinical benefit in a
       confirmatory trial(s).

       Krazati was approved under the accelerated approval pathway. This pathway can allow for
       earlier approval of drugs intended to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need.
       Accelerated approval is based on an effect on a surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint
       that is thought to be reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, rather than on a direct
       measurement of clinical benefit. FDA has required sponsors of drugs approved under the
       accelerated approval pathway, including Krazati, to conduct a confirmatory trial to verify and
       describe the clinical benefit of the drug.⁴

       The PI for Krazati includes warnings and precautions regarding gastrointestinal adverse
       reactions, QTc interval prolongation, hepatotoxicity, and interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis.
       The most common adverse reactions reported with use of Krazati include nausea, diarrhea,
       vomiting, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, hepatotoxicity, renal impairment, edema, dyspnea,
       and decreased appetite.

**False or Misleading Benefit Presentation**

       Prescription drug advertisements and labeling (promotional communications) misbrand a
       drug if they are false or misleading with respect to efficacy. The determination of whether a
       promotional communication is misleading includes, among other things, not only
       representations made or suggested in the promotional communication, but also the extent to
       which the promotional communication fails to reveal facts material in light of the
       representations made or with respect to consequences that may result from the use of the
       drug as recommended or suggested in the promotional communication.

       All of the presentations described below are found in the “Efficacy” menu item, under the
       “Clinical Data” sub-navigation menu of the website for Krazati. The main “Efficacy” menu
       landing page includes the following banner as a preface to the presentations (underlined
       emphasis added):

              “KRYSTAL-1 EFFICACY

              Scroll to see the efficacy of Krazati.”

       When users scroll “to see the efficacy of Krazati,” they are able to access the presentations
       described in this letter on a horizontal navigation bar with the following navigation bar item
