                   Gallium-68                  (b) (4) (68Ga-PSMA(b) (4))
                   MA 1

Dear Dr. Czernin:

The Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (OPDP) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has reviewed a webpage¹ entitled “Prostate Cancer Imaging: PSMA-PET Imaging for
Prostate Cancer” (webpage) and a brochure available through the webpage entitled “New
imaging test accurately detects prostate-cancer cells throughout the body” (brochure) for the
investigational new drug Gallium-68 (b) (4) (Ga68-PSMA(b) (4)). You are
receiving this letter as the authorized representative of UCLA, the sponsor of Ga68-PSMA(b) (4)
(b) (4) The webpage and brochure suggest in a promotional context that Ga68-PSMA(b) (4), an
investigational new drug, is safe and effective for the purpose for which it is being
investigated or otherwise promotes the drug. As a result, Ga68-PSMA(b) (4) is misbranded
under section 502(f)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and in
violation of section 301(k) of the FD&C Act. The claims in the webpage and brochure are
concerning from a public health perspective because they make conclusory representations
in a promotional context regarding the safety and efficacy of an investigational new drug that
has not been approved by the FDA and whose safety and efficacy have not yet been
established.

Background

Ga68-PSMA(b) (4) is an investigational new drug for which there is no marketing authorization
in the United States. (b) (4)

Misbranding of an Investigational Drug

Under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, a drug shall be deemed to be misbranded unless
its labeling bears adequate directions for use. Under FDA regulations, adequate directions
for use means directions under which the layman can use a drug safely and for the
purposes for which it is intended. 21 CFR 201.5. Your webpage and brochure describe
