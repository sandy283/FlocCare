           localized cases, chemotherapy or hormone therapy might be appropriate in cases
           where PSMA-PET imaging detects prostate-cancer cells in the bone or lymph nodes.
           PSMA-PET imaging allows for more informed care, with likely better outcomes as a
           result.”

   •   “Ga-PSMA PET CT is now offered at UCLA and aims to improve management of
       recurrent and high-risk cancers.”

The above claims make numerous conclusory statements about the safety and effectiveness
of Ga68-PSMA(b) (4) suggesting that it is a “[n]ew imaging test [that] accurately detects
prostate-cancer cells throughout the body” that “represents a major advance in detecting
prostate cancer” with “no common side effects or significant risks” and that “[i]n contrast to
traditional studies, PSMA-PET imaging offers high sensitivity and specificity” in “detecting the
location of prostate-cancer recurrences.” Thus, these claims and presentations suggest in a
promotional context that Ga68-PSMA(b) (4), an investigational new drug, is safe or effective for
such uses, when FDA has not approved Ga68-PSMA(b) (4) for any use.

Conclusion and Requested Action

For the reasons discussed above, Ga68-PSMA(b) (4) is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of
the FD&C Act and in violation of section 301(k) of the FD&C Act. The claims in the webpage
and brochure are concerning from a public health perspective because they make
representations in a promotional context regarding the safety and efficacy of an
investigational new drug that has not been approved by the FDA.

OPDP requests that UCLA immediately cease violating the FD&C Act, as discussed above.
Please submit a written response to this letter on or before January 12, 2018, stating whether
you intend to comply with this request, listing all promotional materials for Ga68-PSMA(b) (4)
that contain statements such as those described above, and explaining your plan for
discontinuing use of such violative materials.

Please direct your response to the undersigned at the **Food and Drug Administration,**
