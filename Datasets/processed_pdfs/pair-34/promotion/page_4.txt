COMPLETE PAGE ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------
The PSMA-PET imaging test works by marking an antigen receptor that sits on
the surface of every prostate-cancer cell, called PSMA, with a radioactive peptide,
Gallium-68. This process allows the cancer cells to be detected wherever they are
located, including outside of the pelvic region.

The procedure is similar to other PET/CT scans. The patient is given an intravenous
injection of the radioisotope (68Ga), followed an hour later by an intravenous
injection of contrast dye for the CT portion of the PET/CT scan. The actual scan time
is about 20 minutes. There are no common side effects or significant risks, and the
procedure takes a maximum of two hours from start to finish. There are no dietary
restrictions prior to the test.

**How PSMA-PET compares to current tests**

Once rising serum PSA levels are noted on a blood test, doctors often conduct a
multiparametric MRI, which can locate cancer cells in the prostate gland. Some also
use ultrasound and CT scans to pinpoint where the cancer is located, although both
sometimes lack sufficient sensitivity to determine the true extent of the disease.

To detect metastatic disease in bone, lymph nodes or soft tissue, doctors might order
various types of bone scans, or acetate or choline PET/CT scans. However, these tests
can sometimes miss disease or return false-positive findings. The sodium fluoride
PET/CT scan looks for variations in bone structure, which could indicate cancer.
But because of its low specificity, it can flag areas where thereâ€™s arthritis or injury.

The acetate/choline PET/CT scan, on the other hand, uses as its radioactive tracer
a precursor of lipids used to build tumor cell membranes that prostate-cancer cells
should absorb. But this test lacks sensitivity, and doesn't work well in cases of prostate-
cancer recurrence where prostate-specific antigen levels are low.

**Guiding treatment decisions**

In contrast to the traditional studies, PSMA-PET imaging offers high sensitivity and
specificity. Because the test looks specifically for the antigen that sits on prostate-cancer
cells, it finds these cancer cells wherever they are, while avoiding false-positive results.

Whereas the unreliable results of traditional tests can lead to unnecessary or
insufficient disease treatment and management decisions, PSMA-PET allows doctors
to make more informed treatment decisions. While radiation and surgery are typical
in localized cases, chemotherapy or hormone therapy might be appropriate in cases
where PSMA-PET imaging detects prostate-cancer cells in the bone or lymph nodes.

PSMA-PET imaging allows for more informed care, with likely better outcomes as
a result. The UCLA team uses PSMA-PET imaging to identify the site of disease
recurrence in patients whose blood PSA levels start rising after initial prostate-cancer
therapy. The test is also used to determine the extent of the disease prior to surgery.
