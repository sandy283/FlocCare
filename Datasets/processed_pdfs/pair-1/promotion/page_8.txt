(The main part of the page is white and features a diagram illustrating the chemical structures and interconversion pathways of four estrogens. The diagram is composed of labeled chemical structures and arrows indicating transformations.)

(Top center of the diagram:)
Estrone (E1)
(Chemical structure of Estrone (E1) is shown, with -OH and =O groups and hydrogens marked.)

(Middle left of the diagram:)
Estradiol (E2)
(Chemical structure of Estradiol (E2) is shown, with -OH groups and hydrogens marked.)

(Middle right of the diagram:)
Estriol (E3)
(Chemical structure of Estriol (E3) is shown, with -OH groups and hydrogens marked.)

(Arrows connect Estrone (E1), Estradiol (E2), and Estriol (E3) forming a closed loop, indicating interconversion:
- A downward arrow from Estrone (E1) to Estradiol (E2).
- An upward arrow from Estradiol (E2) to Estrone (E1).
- A rightward arrow from Estradiol (E2) to Estriol (E3).
- A leftward arrow from Estriol (E3) to Estradiol (E2).
- A downward-right arrow from Estrone (E1) to Estriol (E3).
- An upward-left arrow from Estriol (E3) to Estrone (E1).)

(Bottom center of the diagram, enclosed in a light pink dashed oval:)
Estetrol (E4)
(Chemical structure of Estetrol (E4) is shown, with -OH groups and a CH3 group, and hydrogens marked.)

(Two downward-pointing arrows originate from the interconversion loop of E1, E2, E3 and point towards the area of Estetrol (E4), indicating a relationship but not necessarily interconversion.)

(To the left of Estetrol (E4), a pink rectangular highlight contains white text, appearing to be related to E4's unique nature:)
E4 has no
