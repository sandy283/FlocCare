What Is Estetrol (E4)?

Estetrol is a native human estrogen produced by the fetus during pregnancy¹
Estetrol in NEXTSTELLIS is a synthetic estrogen manufactured from a plant source²,³

This section displays a diagram illustrating the process of obtaining Estetrol (E4) from a plant source. The diagram flows from left to right:
1.  **Image:** A light green plant with roots and multiple leaves.
    **Text below image:** Soy
2.  **Arrow:** A large gray arrow pointing right.
    **Text above arrow:** extraction
3.  **Image:** A gray mortar and pestle, with some plant leaves inside the mortar. Next to the mortar, a gray dropper is shown.
    **Text below image:** Phytosterols
    **Chemical Structure 1:** Above this stage, a chemical structure is shown with a four-ring steroid nucleus, an oxygen double-bonded to the A-ring (likely at C3) and a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to the D-ring (likely at C17). This structure represents a ketonic steroid, consistent with Estrone (E1).
4.  **Arrow:** A large gray arrow pointing right.
5.  **Image:** A light pink, abstract, irregular shape, resembling a mountainous or crystalline formation.
    **Text below image:** Estrone (E1)
6.  **Arrow:** A large gray arrow pointing right.
7.  **Image:** A white, circular pill with a faint, light gray 'A' or 'Q' shaped logo embossed on its surface.
    **Text below image:** Estetrol (E4)
    **Chemical Structure 2:** Above this final product, another chemical structure is depicted. It also features a four-ring steroid nucleus, with multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) attached to various positions on the rings, characteristic of a highly hydroxylated steroid like Estetrol (E4).
