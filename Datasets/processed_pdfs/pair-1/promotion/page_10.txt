Here is the extracted text content from the PDF page, preserving its original layout and structure:

**Ethinyl Estradiol (EE) Receptor Activity**

There is a diagram illustrating the two forms of Estrogen Receptor Alpha (ERα) and their locations:
*   On the left, an arrow points to a circular, dotted outline labeled **ERα nucleus**, representing the nuclear estrogen receptor alpha.
*   On the right, an arrow points to a more elongated, capsule-shaped, dotted outline labeled **ERα membrane**, representing the membrane estrogen receptor alpha.
This diagram suggests that Ethinyl Estradiol (EE) acts as an agonist for both nuclear and membrane ERα receptors.

**Agonist at all sites¹**

*   Activates both the nuclear and membrane estrogen receptor¹
*   Has estrogenic activity on the vagina, endometrium, bone, vascular system, brain, liver, and breast¹⁻³

Below the bullet points, there is a row of six dark teal-colored icons, visually representing the organs and systems mentioned in the second bullet point where ethinyl estradiol has estrogenic activity:
*   A stylized icon of a uterus (representing the vagina and endometrium).
*   A stylized icon of a bone (representing bone).
*   A stylized icon of a branching tree-like structure (possibly representing the vascular system or general systemic effect).
*   A stylized icon of a brain (representing the brain).
*   A stylized icon of a liver (representing the liver).
*   A stylized icon of a breast (representing the breast).
