**Description of Visual Elements:**

1.  **Bar Chart:** This is a bar chart displaying the percentage of women experiencing unscheduled bleeding/spotting or unscheduled bleeding only, across different treatment cycles (1, 2, 6, 8, 12).
    *   The Y-axis represents "Women (%)" ranging from 0.0% to 10.0%.
    *   The X-axis represents "Cycle" with labels 1, 2, 6, 8, and 12.
    *   There are two types of bars for each cycle, distinguished by color:
        *   **Light blue bars** represent "Unscheduled bleeding/spottingᵃ". These bars generally show a higher percentage across cycles, decreasing slightly over time.
        *   **Dark purple bars** represent "Unscheduled bleeding (only)". These bars show a lower percentage than the light blue bars and generally appear consistent or slightly decreasing across cycles.
    *   An annotation near Cycle 12 highlights the dark purple bar for that cycle with a pink box containing "2%" and "Bleeding Only," indicating that 2% of women experienced unscheduled bleeding only at this point (or the peak across cycles shown).

2.  **Summary Boxes (Right Side):**
    *   **"TREATMENT DISCONTINUATION" Box (Pink, dashed border):** This box presents key statistics regarding study discontinuation. It states that "2.8%" of patients withdrew from treatment due to bleeding irregularities.
    *   **"SCHEDULED BLEEDING" Box (Light blue, dashed border):** This box provides information about scheduled bleeding. It states that "85%" of women experienced regular withdrawal bleeding, with a range of "82% to 87% across cycles."
