Discovery of Estetrol (E4)—a Native Estrogen

Produced by the fetal liver, **estetrol** is a
**native estrogen** present from week 9 of gestation¹,⁴

*   The physiologic function of estetrol has yet to be
    fully understood⁵

Fetal plasma levels of estetrol are up to
**12 times higher**
than those of the mother²,³

**Visual Element Description:**
Below the text about fetal plasma levels, there is a bar chart titled "E4 plasma levels (pg/mL)" on the Y-axis, ranging from 0 to 16,000. It compares two sets of plasma levels:
1.  **Mother's levels:** Represented by a purple bar and an icon of a simplified human figure. The text associated with this bar indicates "400-1,200 pg/mL".
2.  **Fetal levels:** Represented by a pink bar and an icon of a fetus/embryo. The text associated with this bar indicates "4,500-14,000 pg/mL".
The chart visually demonstrates that fetal plasma levels are significantly higher than the mother's plasma levels, supporting the claim that they are "up to 12 times higher".
