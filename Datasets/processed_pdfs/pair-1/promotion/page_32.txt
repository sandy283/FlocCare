(Two bar charts are presented side-by-side. Both charts show data for "Baseline," "Cycle 7," and "Cycle 13," represented by dark purple, pink, and light blue bars respectively. Error bars are included for each bar.)

**Left Chart Description:**
*   **Title/X-axis label:** Fasting Glucose
*   **Y-axis label:** mmol/L
*   **Y-axis values:** 0 to 6
*   **Data represented:** The chart shows three bars, each with a similar height, indicating that Fasting Glucose levels remained relatively stable across Baseline, Cycle 7, and Cycle 13. The values for all three time points appear to be around 4.5-5 mmol/L.

**Right Chart Description:**
*   **Title/X-axis label:** Glycated Hemoglobin (A1C)
*   **Y-axis label:** mmol/mol
*   **Y-axis values:** 0 to 40
*   **Data represented:** The chart shows three bars, each with a similar height, indicating that Glycated Hemoglobin (A1C) levels remained relatively stable across Baseline, Cycle 7, and Cycle 13. The values for all three time points appear to be around 32-33 mmol/mol.

(Below the charts, a legend and additional text are provided.)
