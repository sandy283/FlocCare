Likelihood of VTEs in Women

This page presents data on the likelihood of developing Venous Thromboembolisms (VTEs) in women across different states and compares them to the VTE rate for NEXTSTELLIS.

**Likelihood of Developing a VTE¹**
(Bar Chart)

The chart displays the number of women with a blood clot out of 10,000 women-years (WY) for various groups:

*   **NONPREGNANT**
    **NON-COC USER**
    Ranges from
    **1 to 5**
    [Visual: A short blue bar]

*   **COC-USER**
    Ranges from
    **3 to 9**
    [Visual: A slightly longer blue bar]

*   **Pregnancyᵃ**
    Ranges from
    **5 to 20**
    [Visual: A moderately long blue bar]

*   **Postpartum**
    **(12 weeks only)**
    Ranges from
    **40 to 65**
    [Visual: A much longer blue bar, extending furthest to the right]

The x-axis represents the "Number of women with a blood clot out of 10,000 women-years (WY)" and is scaled from 0 to 70 in increments of 10.
