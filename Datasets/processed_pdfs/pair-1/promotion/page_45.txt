COMPLETE PAGE ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------
Supporting Equitable Access to Contraceptives

*   In January 2023, the US Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Treasury began enforcement of the
    2022 guidance to remove barriers to preventative care and contraception for women
*   New guidance reinforces the requirement that **plans must cover any contraceptive services and FDA-approved, cleared,
    or granted contraceptive products that a patient and their provider have determined to be medically appropriate
    without cost-sharing**
*   Plans may not use “Unreasonable Medical Management Techniques” in their determination, which include:
    *   Denying coverage for newer or brand name contraceptives
    *   Applying age-related restrictions for a contraceptive service or product
    *   Requiring patients to satisfy a step-therapy or “fail first” approach

**Table: Reporting of Violations**

This table provides information on where consumers can report violations related to contraceptive coverage based on their insurance type.
