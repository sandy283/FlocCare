**Visual Elements Description:**
The page presents a structured overview of a clinical development program.
At the top, a large banner with a light blue background features the main title: "Estetrol (E4) and NEXTSTELLIS: Extensive Clinical Development Program¹⁻⁶".
Below this, the core information is presented in three distinct, horizontally arranged rectangular boxes, each representing a phase of development. Each box has a dashed border at the top and solid borders for the other sides.
-   **Phase 1 (leftmost box):** Titled "Phase 1" with a timeframe of "2005 - 2007". A vertical light blue bar on its left side is labeled "E4 Only". The box lists bullet points: "Single oral dose", "Multiple oral dose", and "Proof-of-concept".
-   **Four Phase 2 Trials (middle box):** Titled "Four Phase 2 Trials (N=681)" with a timeframe of "2008 - 2014". A vertical pink bar on its left side is labeled "E4 + progestins (LNG or DRSP)". The box describes "2 dose-finding studies evaluating E4+DRSP or LNG" and "2 head-to-head studies against Yaz® and Nordette®". It then lists "Endpoints included:" with bullet points: "Dose-finding", "Bleeding profile", "Hemostasis, endocrine, and metabolic parameters", and "Ovulation inhibition".
-   **Two Phase 3 Trials (rightmost box):** Titled "Two Phase 3 Trials (N=3,632)" with a timeframe of "2015 - 2020". A vertical purple bar on its left side is labeled "E4 14.2 mg/DRSP 3 mg". The box describes "2 pivotal contraceptive trials in US/Canada and EU/Russia". It then lists "Endpoints included:" with bullet points: "On-treatment pregnancy rate (Pearl Index) in at-risk cyclesᵃ", "Cycle control (bleeding pattern)ᵇ", "Safety – AEsᵇ", and "Subject’s well-beingᵇ".

Blue arrow shapes visually connect the phases, indicating progression from Phase 1 to Phase 2, and from Phase 2 to Phase 3. These arrows extend from the bottom-right of one phase box to the left side of the next.

At the bottom of the page, there is a page number "13" on the left. Next to it, a black circular logo with "mayne pharma" in white text is displayed. To the right of the logo, there is a block of smaller text containing abbreviations definitions ("AEs, adverse events; DRSP, drospirenone; LNG, levonorgestrel."), footnotes ("ᵃPrimary endpoint, ages 16-35 years. ᵇSecondary endpoints, ages 16-50 years."), and a list of six references. Below the references, a statement reads: "Full Prescribing Information is available at www.Nextstellis.com". In the bottom right corner, aligned to the right, a small text reads: "All registered trademarks are the property of their respective owners".
