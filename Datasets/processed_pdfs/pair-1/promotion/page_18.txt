**Endocrine Effects at Cycle 6 vs Baseline¹,²**
**Study Reference: Es0001-C201**

a p < 0.05 DRSP/E4 vs LNG/EE and DRSP/EE
b p < 0.05 DRSP/E4 vs LNG/EE or DRSP/EE

The page displays a bar chart titled "Endocrine Effects at Cycle 6 vs Baseline". The y-axis is labeled "% Change From Baseline at Cycle 6" and ranges from -100 to 300. The x-axis lists various endocrine parameters or substances. Each parameter has three bars representing different drug regimens, as detailed in the legend below the chart. Statistical significance markers ('a' and 'b') are placed above some bars to indicate specific p-value comparisons.

*   **X-axis categories (from left to right):**
    *   Total T
    *   Free T
    *   Cortisol (with 'a' above the first bar)
    *   Aldosterone
    *   CBG
    *   SHBG (with 'b' above the first bar and 'a' above the third bar)
    *   TBG
    *   Angiotensinogen (with 'a' above the first bar)

*   **Chart Legend:**
    *   DRSP 3 mg/E4 15 mg (n=38) (represented by a dark red/maroon bar)
    *   LNG 150 mcg/EE 30 mcg (n=29) (represented by a blue/teal bar)
    *   DRSP 3 mg/EE 20 mcg (n=31) (represented by a pink/magenta bar)
