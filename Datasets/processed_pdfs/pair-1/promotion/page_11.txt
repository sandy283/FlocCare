The Unique Dual Role of Estetrol (E4)
Results in Tissue Selective Actions

[Diagram illustrating the dual action of Estetrol (E4). A central gray blob-like shape (representing Estetrol) has two gray arrows originating from it.
The left arrow points to "ERα nucleus". Below this, text reads "Agonist at the nuclear ERα" in a light blue box with a dashed border.
The right arrow points to "ERα membrane". Below this, text reads "Antagonist at the membrane ERα" in a pink box with a dashed border.]

[Boxed section with dashed border, titled "Agonist at the nuclear ERα", corresponding to the left path in the diagram]:
✓ Activates the nuclear estrogen receptor¹⁻³
✓ Has estrogenic activity on the vagina,
    endometrium, bone, vascular system, and brain¹⁻³
[Below this text are four icons: a blue icon of a uterus, a blue icon of a bone, a blue icon of a root-like structure representing the vascular system, and a blue icon of a brain.]

[Boxed section with dashed border, titled "Antagonist at the membrane ERα", corresponding to the right path in the diagram]:
✓ Unlike other estrogens, E4 has a minimal effect
    on the liver. No first pass metabolism–
    metabolized by UGT pathway¹⁻³
✓ E4 has a low impact on breast tissue⁴⁻⁷
[Below this text are two icons: a red icon of a liver and a red icon of a stylized breast.]
