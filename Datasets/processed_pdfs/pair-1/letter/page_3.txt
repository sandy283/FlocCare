The speaker deck includes numerous claims and presentations comparing the
pharmacologic properties and purported benefits of estetrol (e.g., claims of “low impact” and
“minimal effect on the liver”) to those of other estrogens. These claims and presentations
misleadingly suggest that Nextstellis is “unique” and intrinsically different from other
estrogens, making Nextstellis a safer form of estrogen-containing oral contraception due to
its “low-impact” properties. The following claims and presentations in the speaker deck
create this misleading impression (footnotes omitted, underlined emphasis added):

    *   “NEXTSTELLIS is an FDA-approved, combined oral contraceptive (COC) containing
        drospirenone (DRSP) and estetrol (E4)—a novel, **selective action, low-impact**
        estrogen” (slide 3)
    *   “The **native characteristics of estetrol have not required any modification** for its use in
        a contraceptive” (slide 8)
    *   “Estetrol (E4) Has a **Unique Pharmacologic Profile**.” This headline claim is followed
        by a chart comparing numerous pharmacologic parameters of estetrol (highlighted in
        shades of pink) and ethinyl estradiol (presented in gray, black and white). The chart
        includes “Hepatic metabolism” and “Impact on CYP450.” Beside the comparison of
        hepatic metabolism, the slide notes in pink that Estetrol has “Minimal hepatic
        metabolism[.]” Beside the comparison of the impact on CYP450, the slide notes in
        pink that estetrol has “Minimal drug interaction.” (slide 8)
    *   “The **Unique Dual Role of Estetrol (E4) Results in Tissue Selective Actions**” (slide 10)
    *   “**Unlike other estrogens, E4 has a minimal effect on the liver.**” (slide 10; bolded
        emphasis original)
    *   “Estetrol, **a selective action, low-impact, native estrogen**” and “Estetrol is a **low-impact**
        estrogen…” (slide 40)
    *   “NEXTSTELLIS is **the ideal pairing** of estetrol and drospirenone, delivering an
        **effective and safe** combined oral contraceptive with a **unique pharmacologic profile**”
        (slide 41; bolded emphasis original)

These claims and presentations, which appear throughout the speaker deck, suggest that
estetrol is different from—and lower risk than—other estrogens because of purported native
characteristics and a “unique pharmacologic profile” that “results in tissue selective actions”
and a “low impact.” Moreover, these claims and presentations misleadingly suggest that
estetrol has differential selectivity in tissues that distinguishes it functionally from other
estrogens, when this has not been demonstrated. For example, according to the Nextstellis
PI, estetrol is “a synthetic analogue of a native estrogen present during pregnancy, that is
selective for nuclear estrogen receptor-α (ER-α) and ER-β”; however, this is true of all
**estrogens**. Estrogens, including estetrol, act through ER-α and ER-β and have a multiplicity
of end organ effects. The effects in any given tissue depend on a variety of factors beyond
the action of the estrogen itself, such as the mix of co-activators and co-repressors that
determine gene activation, and the presence or absence of alternative signaling pathways.
We are unaware of any data to support the suggestion that estetrol has intrinsic properties
that result in unique pharmacological impacts on tissues that subsequently confer greater
safety for Nextstellis compared to other estrogen products. If you have information or data to
support these suggestions, please submit to FDA for review.

In addition to the overall misleading impression described above, certain individual claims
and presentations elsewhere within the speaker deck are also misleading.
