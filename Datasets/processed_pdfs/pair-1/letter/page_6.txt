While references⁴ are cited for these claims, none support conclusions about the comparative
safety and impact on breast tissue of Nextstellis relative to other CHCs. With the exception of
Singer, et al., the references describe preclinical studies that are based on *in vitro* and *in vivo*
animal data, which do not support clinical conclusions in humans regarding Nextstellis’ effect
on breast tissue, including impacts on the drug’s safety profile. The Singer, et al. reference
investigated estetrol as a hormone replacement in pre- and post-menopausal women with
estrogen-receptor positive early-stage breast cancer and did not study the impacts of estetrol
on breast tissue when used as an oral contraceptive in women of reproductive potential.
These references do not support the presentations and suggestions that, in contrast to ethinyl
estradiol, Nextstellis has a “low impact on” or “does not stimulate” breast tissue. Thus,
implications that estetrol is safer than ethinyl estradiol due to differences in effect on breast
tissue are misleading.

Furthermore, the speaker deck includes several claims that minimize serious risks associated
with the use of Nextstellis. For example, the speaker deck includes the following claims and
presentations regarding parameters grouped as liver effects (bolded emphasis original,
underlined emphasis added, footnotes omitted):

*   “Unlike other estrogens, E4 has a **minimal effect on the liver**.” (slide 10)
*   “Estetrol (E4) Is an Estrogen With Selective Action in Tissues . . .
    *   **Minimal to no impact on** [parameters associated with the liver]:
        *   Cholesterol . . .
        *   <u>Triglycerides</u> . . .
        *   <u>Glucose</u> . . .
        *   <u>Clotting factors</u> . . . (slide 11)
*   “Women experienced **minimal changes** in cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, and
    glycated hemoglobin” (slide 41)

First, these claims misleadingly represent that Nextstellis has “minimal” or “no” impact on
liver parameters, even though the PI for Nextstellis states that the product has several known
risks associated with the liver and liver parameters. The claim that estetrol has “minimal
effect on the liver” misleadingly minimizes the risk to the liver associated with use of
Nextstellis, including patients with liver disease. This is especially concerning because,
according to the CONTRAINDICATIONS section of the PI, Nextstellis is contraindicated in
patients with hepatic adenoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, acute hepatitis, or severe
(decompensated) cirrhosis. The PI for Nextstellis also includes a warning and precaution for
liver disease (elevated liver enzymes and liver tumors). Specifically, according to the
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS section of the PI, Section 5.6, Nextstellis should be
withheld or discontinued if persistent or significant elevation of liver enzymes occurs in
patients. CHCs are known to increase the risk of hepatic tumors, in particular, hepatic
adenomas. The rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death from abdominal hemorrhage.
