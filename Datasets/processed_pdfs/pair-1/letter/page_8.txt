**or not**” (underlined emphasis original, bold emphasis added). This claim creates a
misleading impression that not all of the ARs included in the presentation were related to
Nextstellis treatment and suggests that the true AR rates attributable to use of Nextstellis
were lower, when this is not the case. The Nextstellis PI is cited for this claim. However,
the adverse reactions included in Table 4 of the PI, and included on slide 27, are adverse
reactions for which a causal relationship is plausible. Thus, the claim that the adverse
reactions described in the PI are reported “whether drug related or not” misleadingly
minimizes the risks associated with Nextstellis by downplaying and dissociating the adverse
reactions reported by patients using Nextstellis in the Phase 3 studies.

Furthermore, the risk presentation on slides 34-38 omits material facts regarding the risks of
hyperkalemia, migraine, and bleeding irregularities and amenorrhea associated with
Nextstellis. Specifically, the following material information from the PI is omitted (in pertinent
part, bolded emphasis original, underlined emphasis added):

**4 CONTRAINDICATIONS**

NEXTSTELLIS is contraindicated in females who are known to have or develop the
following conditions:
...
Have migraine headaches with aura

**WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS**
...
**5.2 Hyperkalemia**
NEXTSTELLIS is contraindicated in females with conditions that predispose to
hyperkalemia (e.g., renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and adrenal insufficiency).
...
Monitor females taking NEXTSTELLIS who later develop medical conditions and/or
begin medication that put them at an increased risk for hyperkalemia.
...
**5.4 Migraine**
...
Migraines with aura increase the risk for stroke. This stroke risk is further increased in
females who have migraines with aura with use of CHCs.
...
**5.11 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea**
...
If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, evaluate for causes such
as pregnancy or malignancy.

We acknowledge the statements on slide 34 that “[t]he following ISI is based on the highlights
section of the US Prescribing Information for NEXTSTELLIS” and to “[p]lease consult the full
Prescribing Information for all labelled safety information for NEXTSTELLIS”, as well as the
hyperlink to Nextstellis’ full PI throughout the speaker deck. However, these statements do
not mitigate the misleading minimization of risks associated with use of Nextstellis.
