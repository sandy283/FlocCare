Second, the speaker deck claims that estetrol has “minimal to no impact on...Cholesterol...
Triglycerides...Glucose.” This claim misleadingly minimizes the risks associated with
Nextstellis regarding reduced glucose tolerance and hypertriglyceridemia (high triglycerides),
including patients with prediabetes, diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia or family history of
hypertriglyceridemia. This is especially concerning because, according to the WARNINGS
AND PRECAUTIONS section of the PI, Section 5.8, patients using Nextstellis should be
carefully monitored for prediabetes and diabetes as Nextstellis may decrease glucose
tolerance. This can lead to an increase of glucose (sugar) in the body and may result in
additional comorbidities if not appropriately treated. Furthermore, Section 5.8 also states that
patients with, or who have a family history of, hypertriglyceridemia are at an increase in
serum triglyceride concentrations when using Nextstellis, which may increase the risk of
pancreatitis. In addition, the PI states that females with hypertriglyceridemia are advised to
consider alternative contraception.

Third, the speaker deck claims that estetrol has “minimal to no impact on . . . clotting factors.”
This misleadingly minimizes the risk of thromboembolic disorders and other vascular
problems. According to the CONTRAINDICATIONS section of the PI, Nextstellis is
contraindicated in patients with a history of, increased risk for, or current arterial or venous
thrombotic/thromboembolic diseases. In addition, according to the WARNINGS AND
PRECAUTIONS section of the PI, Section 5.1, Nextstellis is associated with an increased
risk for cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and venous thromboembolic events and should be
discontinued if such arterial or venous thrombotic/thromboembolic events occur.⁵ Moreover,
certain precautions must be taken when using Nextstellis to help prevent these disorders,
such as discontinuing use during prolonged immobilization.

While references⁶ are cited for these claims on slides 10, 11 and 41, none of these
references support clinical conclusions about the effect of Nextstellis on the liver. These
references include preclinical studies that are based on *in vitro* and *in vivo* animal data, a
review of *in vitro* studies for ERα, an educational review of estetrol and a review of the
mechanisms regulating ER-mediated responses, none of which support clinical conclusions
in humans regarding Nextstellis’ safety profile associated with the liver. Furthermore, the
phase 3 studies conducted in support of the approval of Nextstellis (C301 and C302) were
not designed to support conclusions regarding Nextstellis’ impact on specific tissues/organs.
Therefore, these references do not support the claims that Nextstellis has a “minimal effect
on the liver” or a “minimal downstream impact on liver parameters.”

Slide 27 of the slide deck includes a presentation of adverse reactions, along with the claim,
“Adverse Reactions (ARs) include all Adverse Events (AEs) reported…whether drug related

⁵ Changes in hemostatic parameters are consistent with the known prothrombotic effects of estrogens, and
clinically significant venous thromboemboli were observed in the clinical development program for Nextstellis.
