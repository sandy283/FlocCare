RE:    NDA 214154
       NEXTSTELLIS (drospirenone and estetrol tablets), for oral use
       MA 107

Dear Mandy Edwards:

The Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (OPDP) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has reviewed a promotional communication, a professional “presentation for
NEXTSTELLIS promotional programs with speaker notes” (PM-US-NEX-0360) (speaker
deck) for NEXTSTELLIS (drospirenone and estetrol tablets), for oral use (Nextstellis)
submitted by Mayne Pharma LLC (Mayne) under cover of Form FDA 2253. This speaker
deck makes false or misleading claims and presentations about the risks of Nextstellis. Thus,
the speaker deck misbrands Nextstellis within the meaning of the Federal Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and makes its distribution violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(a); 321(n);
331(a). C.f. 21 CFR 202.1(e)(3)(i); (e)(5). These violations are concerning from a public
health perspective because this speaker deck creates a misleading impression about the
risks a patient may experience as a result of using Nextstellis in comparison to other
estrogen-containing combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs), and minimizes the risks
associated with Nextstellis. The speaker deck is particularly concerning given that Nextstellis
is associated with a number of serious and potentially life-threatening risks, including a boxed
warning regarding increased risk of serious cardiovascular events from cigarette smoking and
CHC use.

Background

Below are the indication and summary of the most serious and most common risks
associated with the use of Nextstellis.1

According to the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section of the FDA-approved prescribing
information (PI):

       NEXTSTELLIS is indicated for use by females of reproductive potential to prevent
       pregnancy.
