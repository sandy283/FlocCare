Slide 8 of the speaker deck includes a comparison of pharmacologic profile parameters for
“Ethinyl estradiol” and “Estetrol” that misleadingly suggests that estetrol has safety
advantages over ethinyl estradiol as a component of a CHC because of parameters like
hepatic metabolism and drug interactions, when this has not been demonstrated. For
example, the presentation that estetrol has “minimal” (UGT2B7 pathway) hepatic metabolism
compared to the “slow, extensive (CYP450 pathway)” hepatic metabolism for ethinyl estradiol
misleadingly suggests that estetrol, and therefore Nextstellis, is safer for the liver than CHCs
that with ethinyl estradiol. The contribution of hepatic UGT2B7 metabolism to the overall
metabolism of estetrol is unknown. Thus, the suggestion that Nextstellis is safer for the liver
than other CHCs because a component of Nextstellis uses the UGT2B7 pathway while CHCs
exclusively use the CYP450 pathway is misleading. Similarly, using the parameter of “Impact
on CYP450” to claim that estetrol has “minimal drug interaction” while “Ethinyl estradiol” has
“extensive” impact misleadingly suggests that estetrol, and therefore Nextstellis, has fewer
drug interactions compared to CHCs that use ethinyl estradiol. In general, the drug interaction
potential of a CHC cannot be assessed based only on the estrogenic component. Rather,
both the combined estrogenic and progestin components must be assessed to determine
drug interaction potential. Even though the estetrol component of Nextstellis shows no
potential for CYP450 related drug interaction, the drospirenone component (i.e., the progestin
component) of Nextstellis does have CYP450-related drug interaction potential. While two
references² are cited on slide 8 for these claims, neither support conclusions about the
differential impact of estetrol and ethinyl estradiol on drug interactions or hepatic metabolism.
In fact, neither reference directly compared estetrol to ethinyl estradiol on any pharmacologic
parameter in this slide. If you have information or data to support these suggestions, please
submit to FDA for review.

The misleading suggestion that Nextstellis is safer than other CHCs is further amplified by
the presentation on slides 17 and 18, which claims to show the differential impact of the
active ingredients in Nextstellis (“DRSP 3mg/E4 15 mg”) and two other CHCs (“LNG
150mcg/EE 30mcg” and “DRSP 3mg/EE 20mcg”) on endocrine and hemostatic parameters.
