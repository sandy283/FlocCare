Monitoring and side effects

Monitoring

As with other medicines for Cushing's, monitoring by your
doctor is important so they know how you're doing

     Measuring your cortisol during treatment with Recorlev helps your doctor tell if
     it is under control

     Heart and liver tests before and during treatment with Recorlev will help your
     doctor avoid side effects
