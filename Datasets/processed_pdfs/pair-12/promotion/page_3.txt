**Description of Visual Elements:**

*   **Two Information Boxes:** There are two distinct, light-colored rectangular boxes with rounded corners positioned centrally towards the top of the page. These boxes present summarized clinical trial results.
    *   The **top box** is labeled "Recorlev" on the left side, and on the right, it states: "More patients (52%) who were on a stable and steady dose of Recorlev had normal cortisol levels*".
    *   The **bottom box** is labeled "Placebo (a medicine with no effect)" on the left side, and on the right, it states: "Patients who stopped taking Recorlev and started taking a placebo lost control of their cortisol levels* (6% had normal cortisol levels*)".
    These boxes serve to quickly highlight key efficacy findings related to Recorlev and placebo. The asterisk (*) indicates there is likely a footnote or further explanation not visible on this page.

*   **Expandable Information Icon:** In the bottom right corner of the section starting with "INDICATION AND IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR Recorlev®", there is a blue circle containing a white plus sign. This typically indicates an interactive element that, if clicked, would expand to reveal more detailed information or sections.
