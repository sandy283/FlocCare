RE: NDA 214133
     RECORLEV (levoketoconazole) tablets, oral
     MA 14

Dear Michele Yelmene:

The Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (OPDP) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has reviewed the promotional communications, the “What is Recorlev®?” and “Taking
Recorlev®” webpages¹ of the consumer website (US-REC-21-00033 [v1.0]) (webpages) for
RECORLEV (levoketoconazole) tablets, oral (Recorlev) submitted by Xeris Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. (Xeris) under cover of form FDA 2253. The webpages make false or misleading claims
and representations about the safety and efficacy of Recorlev. Thus, the webpages
misbrand Recorlev within the meaning of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C
Act), making its distribution violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(a), (n); 321(n), 331(a). See 21 CFR
202.1(e)(3)(i); (e)(5). These violations are especially concerning from a public health
perspective because the promotional communications create a misleading impression
regarding the safety and effectiveness of Recorlev, a drug with a number of serious and
potentially life-threatening risks, including boxed warnings regarding the risks of
hepatotoxicity and QT prolongation.

Background

Below are the indication and summary of the most serious and most common risks
associated with the use of Recorlev.² According to the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section
of the FDA-approved prescribing information (PI):

            RECORLEV is indicated for the treatment of endogenous hypercortisolemia in adult
            patients with Cushing’s syndrome for whom surgery is not an option or has not been
            curative.
