and we are not aware of data to support these claims. First, the Data on File⁴, which is cited
on the webpage as support, reports calculated ratios of the average absolute amount of
weight loss for Qsymia compared to placebo at week 12, 28, and 56. However, the cited
calculations do not support the rate of weight loss since they describe the amount of weight
loss at specific points in time. Additionally, although the calculations were derived from the
clinical studies included in the PI, they cannot support a claim of “faster” weight loss because
the studies were not designed to evaluate the rate of weight loss over time. According to the
CLINCIAL STUDIES section of the PI, the co-primary efficacy outcomes measured the
amount of weight loss after 1 year of treatment (a fixed point in time) as the percent of weight
loss from baseline weight and treatment response (defined as achieving at least 5% weight
loss from baseline). These studies were designed to evaluate the amount of weight loss and
cannot be used to support claims regarding rate of weight loss. Therefore, the cited
references do not support the misleading suggestion that Qsymia can help patients lose
weight 3 times faster than diet and exercise alone. If you have data to support these claims,
please submit such data to FDA for review.

The webpage also presents the following claims (emphasis original):

*   “For patients with a body mass index (BMI)* of 30+† or 27 kg/mg² or greater
    (overweight) in the presence of of at least one weight-related medical condition.

**Lose weight and keep it off with Qsymia**[3,4]
....
**12 Weeks**
**Your first milestone**
15-19 Pounds of weight loss                     2-3 Inches off your waist

**28 Weeks**
**Stay motivated**
22-29 Pounds of weight loss                     3-4 Inches off your waist

**56 Weeks**
**Maintain progress**
24-32 Pounds of weight loss                     4-5 Inches off your waist”

This presentation omits material information from the full indication about the relative effect of
diet and exercise. According to the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section of the PI, Qsymia is
indicated as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity. This
presentation is misleading because it does not include this important information. We note
that the webpage contains illustrations showing an exercise bike, a bag of groceries, and a
capsule. However, these are not adequate to convey to the viewer that both exercise and
diet are necessary in achieving the benefits (weight management) of Qsymia as stated in the
PI. Additionally, the omission of contextual information about the results observed in the
placebo group creates a misleading presentation because it suggests that these results are
or can be attributable to Qsymia alone.
