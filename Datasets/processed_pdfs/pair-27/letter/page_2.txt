False or Misleading Claims about Efficacy

Promotional materials misbrand a drug if they are false or misleading with respect to efficacy.
The determination of whether promotional materials are misleading includes, among other
things, not only representations made or suggested in promotional materials, but also failure
to reveal facts material in light of the representations made or with respect to consequences
that may result from the use of the drug as recommended or suggested in the materials.

The webpage includes the following claims (bolded emphasis original, underlined emphasis
added):

* "On average, prescription Qsymia can help you lose weight 3 times **faster** than
  diet and exercise alone.[3,4]"

* "**3X**
  **FASTER WEIGHT LOSS**"

These claims misleadingly suggest that Qsymia can help patients lose weight 3 times faster
than diet and exercise alone. However, the cited references3,4 do not support this suggestion.
