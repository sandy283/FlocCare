RE:   NDA 022580
      QSYMIA (phentermine and topiramate extended-release) capsules, for oral use, CIV
      MA 414

Dear Dr. Varghese,

The Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (OPDP) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has reviewed the homepage of the consumer website¹ (webpage) [100028.42-USP]
for QSYMIA (phentermine and topiramate extended-release) capsules, for oral use, CIV
(Qsymia) submitted by VIVUS, Inc. (Vivus) under cover of Form FDA 2253. The webpage
makes false or misleading claims and/or representations about the efficacy of and risks
associated with Qsymia. As a result, the webpage misbrands Qsymia within the meaning of
the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), and makes distribution of the product
violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(a), (n); 331(a); 321(n). See 21 CFR 202.1(e)(1); 202.1(e)(5);
202.1(e)(7)(viii). The webpage is especially concerning from a public health perspective
because it creates a misleading impression regarding the overall effect a patient may expect
as a result of Qsymia treatment and deemphasizes the risks associated with taking the drug.
Obesity and excessive weight are significant public health concerns that affect millions of
adults in the United States and are associated with numerous co-morbidities. Consumers
and patients who seek assistance with their weight-loss goals should not be misled regarding
the actual benefits, serious risks, and necessary nutritional and lifestyle modifications
associated with the use of a weight management prescription drug product, such as Qsymia.
