In addition, this presentation creates a misleading impression regarding the efficacy of
Qsymia by selectively presenting more favorable data. Specifically, this presentation
selectively presents the more favorable absolute amount of weight loss and reduction in waist
circumference, which fails to account for an individual's baseline weight and waist
circumference. According to the CLINICAL STUDIES section of the PI, these efficacy
outcomes were measured in the context of a patient's baseline weight and waist
circumference. By failing to account for an individual's baseline weight and waist
circumference and omitting this context on the webpage, this presentation misleadingly
implies that all patients, no matter their baseline weight or waist circumference, should expect
to achieve results similar to the absolute amounts presented on the webpage under the
claims “Your first milestone,” “Stay motivated” and “Maintain progress.”

Finally, this presentation primarily reflects patient data⁵ from distinct points during the clinical
trials of only those who remained on Qsymia. According to the CLINICAL STUDIES section
of the PI, a substantial percentage of patients withdrew their participation from the studies
prior to the conclusion of the trials at week 56 - 40% in Study 1 and 31% in Study 2. The
above claims fail to account for these patients who withdrew from the studies. By selectively
presenting results without this contextual information, the presentation overstates the efficacy
of the product and misleadingly implies all patients who received Qsymia remained on
treatment.

**False or Misleading Risk Presentation**

Promotional materials misbrand a drug if they are false or misleading with respect to risk.
The determination of whether promotional materials are misleading includes, among other
things, not only representations made or suggested in promotional materials, but also failure
to reveal facts material in light of the representations made or with respect to consequences
that may result from the use of the drug as recommended or suggested in the materials.

The webpage fails to present information relating to contraindications, warnings, precautions,
and adverse reactions for Qsymia with a prominence and readability reasonably comparable
with the presentation of information relating to the benefits of Qsymia. Factors impacting
prominence and readability include typography, layout, contrast, headlines, paragraphing,
white space, and other techniques apt to achieve emphasis. Specifically, benefit claims for
Qsymia are presented in conjunction with colorful graphics and large bolded headlines with
significant white space. However, the risk information is relegated to the bottom of the
webpage in paragraph format and is not easily accessible to viewers who must “scroll” down
the webpage past the entire benefit presentation. Additionally, the webpage does not present
any significant signal to alert the viewer that important risk information follows the
presentation of benefit information.

**Conclusion and Requested Action**

For the reasons discussed above, the webpage misbrands Qsymia within the meaning of the
FD&C Act and makes distribution of the product violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(a),(n); 331(a);
321(n). See 21 CFR 202.1(e)(1); 202.1(e)(5); 202.1(e)(7)(viii).

⁵ The data is primarily derived from three subset populations who remained on treatment at Weeks 12, 28, and
56, respectively.
