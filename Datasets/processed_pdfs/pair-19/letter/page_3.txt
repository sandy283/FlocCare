The video also includes the following claims (emphasis added, in pertinent part):
*   “I have been on handfuls of different prescriptions and over-the-counter medications,
    and none of them have really worked for me. Or if they worked, and maybe it was a
    one or two time thing and then they didn’t work consistently after that. And I was
    given Nurtec ODT, I tried it, it was a **gamechanger[.]”**
*   “So to have this relief, and to not be in a fog afterwards, to **not like, other**
    **medications would give me rebound headaches, and this one doesn’t** . . .”

These comparative claims are misleading because they suggest that Nurtec ODT is
clinically superior to or more effective than other prescription and over-the-counter (OTC)
products, when this has not been demonstrated. In addition, the use of the word
“gamechanger” in the context of the comparative claim misleadingly suggests that Nurtec
ODT represents a significant advance over other currently available products, when this has
not been demonstrated. While these claims may be an accurate reflection of the
Spokesperson’s own experience with Nurtec ODT, their personal experience does not
support the suggestion that Nurtec ODT is more advanced than or superior to other
migraine drug products on the market. FDA is not aware of evidence to support these
claims. If you have data to support these claims, please submit to FDA for review.

Additionally, the video is misleading because the interview portion of the video
communicates that Nurtec ODT is for the treatment of migraine but it fails to adequately
communicate Nurtec ODT’s full FDA-approved indication and limitations of use.
Specifically, the interview portion of the video fails to convey that Nurtec ODT is approved
for the **acute** treatment of **migraine**, and that **it is not indicated for the preventive treatment of**
**migraine**. OPDP notes that the full indication with limitations of use is presented briefly, at
the end of the video, after the interview portion, in a script/text format on the screen.
However, this does not mitigate the misleading impression.

**False or Misleading Risk Presentation**

Prescription drug advertisements and labeling (promotional communications) misbrand a
drug if they are false or misleading with respect to risk. The determination of whether a
promotional communication is misleading includes, among other things, not only
representations made or suggested in the promotional communication, but also the extent to
which the promotional communication fails to reveal facts material in light of the
representations made or with respect to consequences that may result from the use of the
drug as recommended or suggested in the promotional communication.

The video is misleading because it fails to present information relating to the
contraindications, warnings, precautions, and adverse reactions for Nurtec ODT with a
prominence and readability reasonably comparable with the presentation of information
relating to the benefits of Nurtec ODT. Specifically, the video contains claims and/or
representations about the benefits of Nurtec ODT in the audio portion, while the risk
information is presented in text only format and in small font. Moreover, the risk information
only appears briefly for four seconds at the end of the video, after the close of the
Spokesperson’s presentation, where it is unlikely to draw the viewer’s attention.
