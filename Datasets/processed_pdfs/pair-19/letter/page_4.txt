Additionally, the video does not present any signal to alert the viewer that important risk
information follows after the close of the Spokesperson’s presentation. In fact, the host of
the interview states, “we’ll be right back,” which typically signals the close or end of a
presentation. The overall effect of disclosing risk information in this manner undermines the
communication of risk information and thereby misleadingly minimizes the risks associated
with the use of Nurtec ODT.

**Failure to Submit Under Form FDA-2253**

FDA regulations require any labeling or advertising devised for promotion of the drug product
to be submitted at the time of initial dissemination of the labeling and at the time of initial
publication of the advertisement for a prescription drug product. Each submission is required
to be accompanied by a completed transmittal Form FDA-2253 (Transmittal of
Advertisements and Promotional Labeling for Drugs for Human Use) and is required to
include a copy of the product’s current professional labeling. A copy of the video was not
submitted to OPDP under cover of Form FDA-2253 at the time of initial dissemination as
required by 21 CFR 314.81(b)(3)(i).

**Conclusion and Requested Action**

For the reasons discussed above, the video misbrands Nurtec ODT within the meaning of the
FD&C Act and makes its distribution violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(a), (n); 321(n); 331(a). See 21
CFR 202.1(e)(3)(i), (e)(5), (e)(7)(viii). Furthermore, Biohaven Pharmaceuticals did not
comply with 21 CFR 314.81(b)(3)(i).

This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you with an opportunity to address them.
OPDP requests that Biohaven Pharmaceuticals cease any violations of the FD&C Act.
Please submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt,
addressing the concerns described in this letter, listing all other promotional communications
(with the 2253 submission date) for Nurtec ODT that contain representations like those
described above, and explaining any plan for discontinuing use of such communications, or
for ceasing distribution of Nurtec ODT.

If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, please include in your
submission to us your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration within
15 working days from the date of receipt of this letter.

The concerns discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list of
potential violations. It is your responsibility to ensure compliance with each applicable
requirement of the FD&C Act and FDA implementing regulations.
