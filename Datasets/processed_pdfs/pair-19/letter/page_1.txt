RE: NDA 212728
    NURTEC ODT (rimegepant) orally disintegrating tablets, for sublingual or oral use
    MA 71

Dear Ms. Frost:

The Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (OPDP) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has reviewed a direct-to-consumer video of an interview featuring Khloé Kardashian,
which identifies her as a paid Biohaven Pharmaceuticals spokesperson (Spokesperson).¹
This promotional communication, a video, states it is “SPONSORED BY: Nurtec™ ODT”
(rimegepant) orally disintegrating tablets, for sublingual or oral use (Nurtec ODT). In addition,
the video includes the web-address, “takebacktoday.com,” which redirects the viewer to
www.nurtec.com. The video originally appeared on ABC’s *The View* on July 15, 2020 and
can also be accessed through *The View*’s YouTube page.² The FDA Bad Ad Program also
received a complaint regarding this video.

This video makes false or misleading claims and representations about the risks associated
with and the efficacy of Nurtec ODT. Thus, the video misbrands Nurtec ODT within the
meaning of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and makes its distribution
violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(a), (n); 321(n); 331(a). See 21 CFR 202.1(e)(3)(i); (e)(5); (e)(7)(viii).
In addition, these materials were not submitted at the time of initial dissemination or
publication as required by 21 CFR 314.81(b)(3)(i). These violations are concerning from a
public health perspective because the promotional communication creates a misleading
impression regarding the overall benefit a patient may expect as a result of Nurtec ODT
treatment and minimizes the risks associated with taking the drug.

**Background**

Below are the indication and summary of the most serious and most common risks
associated with the use of Nurtec ODT.³ According to the FDA-approved product labeling
(PI):

¹ In the video, a host of *The View* describes Biohaven Pharmaceuticals as “one of our sponsors.”
² This video is available on the internet at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo_nSDnwOrE (last accessed
date March 8, 2021).
³ This information is for background purposes only and does not necessarily represent the risk information that
should be included in the promotional piece(s) cited in this letter.
