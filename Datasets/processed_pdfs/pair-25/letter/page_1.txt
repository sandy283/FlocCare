RE:    NDA 018680
       ParaGard® T380A INTRAUTERINE COPPER CONTRACEPTIVE
       MA 578

Dear Mr. Hooper:

The Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (OPDP) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has reviewed a Direct-to-Consumer television advertisement (TV ad) entitled
“Paragard 30 sec DTC Ad (Musical)” (US-PAR-1800079) for ParaGard® T380A

(CooperSurgical) under cover of Form FDA 2253. The FDA Bad Ad Program also received a

about the safety of ParaGard.
