presents important risk information about the contraindication for certain cancers and the
precaution for vaginal bleeding only visually as SUPERS.

Furthermore, the TV ad presents unrelated risk and benefit information in competing
modalities that further minimizes the presentation of risk information. Specifically, the TV ad
discloses important risk information about the contraindication for certain cancers in a
SUPER simultaneously with audio containing unrelated risk information about calling a
healthcare provider for pain, pelvic infection, or a missed period. Similarly, the TV ad
discloses important risk information about the precaution for vaginal bleeding in a SUPER
simultaneously with unrelated audio and visual (i.e., as SUPERS) benefit claims that
ParaGard is 100% hormone free and over 99% effective at preventing pregnancy.

The overall effect of compelling and attention-grabbing visuals and other modalities
competing for consumers' attention, disclosing important risk information in SUPERS only,
and the simultaneous presentation of unrelated risks via SUPERS with competing audio
messages undermines the communication of important risk information. As a result, the TV
ad misleadingly minimizes the risks associated with the use of ParaGard. These
presentations in the TV ad are especially problematic from a public health perspective given
the serious and potentially life-threatening risks associated with the drug.

Further, the TV ad includes the following claims and presentations (emphasis original):
*   “No hormones! I found a birth control with no hormones! Paragard’s 100%
    hormone-free . . . !” (VO frames one and two)
*   “No hormones not an ounce! With an ingredient I can pronounce.” (VO frames
    four and five)
*   “**100% HORMONE FREE**” (background visuals frames one through five; SUPER
    frames six and 10).
*   “**1 SIMPLE ACTIVE INGREDIENT**” (background visuals frames one through five;
    SUPER frames six and 10)

The net impression of these claims and presentations further minimize the risks associated
with ParaGard because they misleadingly suggest that, because ParaGard is, “100%
HORMONE FREE[,]” and has, “No hormones not an ounce! With an ingredient I can
pronounce[,]” ParaGard does not have the potential negative health effects of hormone
contraceptives such as long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC), including progesterone-
containing IUDs or implants. Although it is true that ParaGard is hormone-free, the totality of
the overwhelming, repetitive nature of the claims above along with the misleading omission
and presentational elements of the TV ad previously described create a misleading
impression of the safety profile of the drug. In fact, ParaGard is associated with many of the
same serious risks as other LARC products, including risks related to pregnancy and ectopic
pregnancy, and vaginal bleeding.

Moreover, because it is an intrauterine device, there are additional risks to Paragard, some of
which may be fatal, which include embedment, perforation of the myometrium, migration, and
pelvic inflammatory disease. In addition, its active ingredient, copper, is associated with its
own risks as described in the PI, including contraindications for Wilson’s disease, a genetic
disease affecting copper excretion, and allergy to any component of ParaGard, which
