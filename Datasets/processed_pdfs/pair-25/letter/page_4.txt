includes the copper. Additionally, the PI describes a precaution for medical diathermy (short-
wave and microwave heat therapy) in patients with a metal-containing IUD, which may cause
heat injury to the surrounding tissue. Therefore, these claims and presentations are
misleading with respect to ParaGard's safety and further exacerbate the minimization of
ParaGard's serious and potentially life-threatening risks as described above.

Conclusion and Requested Action

For the reasons discussed above, the TV ad misbrands ParaGard within the meaning of the
FD&C Act and makes its distribution violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(n); 331(a); 321(n). 21 CFR
202.1(e)(1); (e)(5).

above. Please submit a written response to this letter on or before August 8, 2019, stating
whether you intend to comply with this request, listing all promotional materials (with the 2253

products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting
information for our consideration.
