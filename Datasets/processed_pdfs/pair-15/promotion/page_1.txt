the heart and blood vessels) such as death, heart attack, or stroke
in people who have heart disease or multiple cardiovascular
risk factors.
• Trulicity is given through an injection (needle). You take it once
  a week by injecting it under the skin of your stomach, thigh, or
  upper arm. Use Trulicity together with the diet and exercise that
  your doctor recommends. Trulicity is not insulin.
