RE: BLA 125469
    TRULICITY® (dulaglutide) injection, for subcutaneous use
    MA 1035

Dear Ms. Ann Robards:

The Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (OPDP) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has reviewed the promotional communication, a social media post, “Trulicity 2020
Instagram Ad – 10,080 Minutes” (PP-DG-US-3210) for TRULICITY® (dulaglutide) injection,
for subcutaneous use (Trulicity) submitted by Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly) under cover of
Form FDA 2253. The FDA Bad Ad Program also received a complaint regarding this post¹
and other posts with similar claims and presentations as the ones discussed in this letter.
This post makes false or misleading claims and representations about the benefits and risks
of Trulicity. Thus, the post misbrands Trulicity within the meaning of the Federal Food, Drug
and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), making its distribution violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(a), (n); 321(n),
331(a). See 21 CFR 202.1 (e)(3)(i); (e)(5); (e)(7)(vii). These violations are especially
concerning from a public health perspective because the promotional communication creates
a misleading impression regarding the safety and effectiveness of Trulicity, which is a drug
with multiple serious, potentially life-threatening risks, including a boxed warning for the risk of
thyroid C-cell tumors. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a significant public health concern that
affects millions of adults in the United States and is associated with numerous co-morbidities.
Consumers and patients who seek assistance with managing their type 2 diabetes mellitus
should receive truthful and non-misleading information regarding the serious risks, and
expected benefits associated with the use of a type 2 diabetes prescription drug product, such
as Trulicity.

**Background**

Below are the indication and summary of the most serious and most common risks
associated with the use of Trulicity.² According to the FDA-approved product labeling (PI)³:
