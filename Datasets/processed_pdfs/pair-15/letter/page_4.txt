Promotional materials are misleading if they fail to present information relating to risks
associated with the drug with a prominence and readability reasonably comparable with the
presentation of information relating to the benefits of the drug. The post prominently presents
benefit claims and representations about Trulicity emphasized by colorful, compelling, and
attention-grabbing fast-paced visuals that take up the majority of the post in a video with
frequent scene changes, busy scenes, and large-moving superimposed text along with other
competing modalities such as the strong, fast-moving musical beat. In contrast, the risk
information is in a small window relegated to the bottom of the post and is presented using
fast-paced, scrolling, small font that is difficult to read and cannot be adequately processed or
comprehended by consumers.

In addition, this presentation fails to include material information from the warning and
precaution for hypoglycemia with concomitant use of insulin secretagogues or insulin.
Specifically, the "What are the possible side effects of TRULICITY?" section of the
Medication Guide states the following (in pertinent part; bolded emphasis original; underlined
emphasis added):

    *   **Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia).** Your risk for getting low blood sugar may be
        <u>higher if you use TRULICITY with another medicine that can cause low blood</u>
        <u>sugar, such as a sulfonylurea or insulin.</u>

By omitting this material information about this risk, the post creates a misleading impression
about the drug's safety.

The overall effect of this presentation undermines the communication of the important risk
information and thereby misleadingly minimizes the risks associated with the use of Trulicity.
The presentation in the post is especially problematic from a public health perspective given
the serious risks associated with the drug.

**Conclusion and Requested Action**

For the reasons discussed above, the post misbrands Trulicity within the meaning of the
FD&C Act and make its distribution violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(a), (n); 321(n); 331(a). See 21
CFR 202.1 (e)(3)(i); (e)(5); (e)(7)(viii).
