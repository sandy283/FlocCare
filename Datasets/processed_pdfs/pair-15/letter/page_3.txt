False or Misleading Benefit Presentation

Prescription drug advertisements and labeling (promotional communications) misbrand a
drug if they are false or misleading with respect to benefits. The determination of whether a
promotional communication is misleading includes, among other things, not only
representations made or suggested in the promotional communication, but also the extent to
which the promotional communication fails to reveal facts material in light of the
representations made or with respect to consequences that may result from the use of the
drug as recommended or suggested in the promotional communication.

The post is misleading because the video portion of the post prominently communicates that
Trulicity can help “lower A1C along with diet and exercise,” but it fails to adequately
communicate Trulicity’s FDA-approved indication and the limitations of use. Specifically, the
**“What is TRULICITY?”** section of the Medication Guide states the following (in pertinent part,
underlined emphasis added):

*   TRULICITY is an injectable prescription medicine that is used:
    *   along with diet and exercise to improve blood sugar (glucose) in adults
        <u>with type 2 diabetes mellitus</u>.
    
    . . .
*   <u>It is not known if TRULICITY can be used in people who have had pancreatitis.</u>
*   <u>TRULICITY is not a substitute for insulin and is not for use in people with type 1
    diabetes or people with diabetic ketoacidosis.</u>
*   <u>TRULICITY is not recommended for use in people with severe stomach or
    intestinal problems.</u>

By failing to adequately communicate the indication and limitations of use associated with
Trulicity, the post creates a misleading impression about the scope of the FDA-approved
indication. This is particularly concerning given the serious risks of this product and the
suggestion that Trulicity will help “lower A1C” in all patients, when this has not been
demonstrated. OPDP notes that the indication and the limitations of use are presented only in
small, fast-paced scrolling font in a small window below the video, relegated to the bottom of
the post, competing for the consumer’s attention with several distracting video elements (fast-
paced visuals, frequent scene changes, busy scenes, large-moving superimposed text, and a
strong fast-moving musical beat) that detract from the communication of the indication and
limitations of use. Therefore, this presentation does not mitigate the misleading impression
created by the post.

False or Misleading Risk Presentation

Prescription drug advertisements and labeling (promotional communications) misbrand a
drug if they are false or misleading with respect to risk. The determination of whether a
promotional communication is misleading includes, among other things, not only
representations made or suggested in the promotional communication, but also the extent to
which the promotional communication fails to reveal facts material in light of the
representations made or with respect to consequences that may result from the use of the
drug as recommended or suggested in the promotional communication.
