At the top left of the page, there is a logo of the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services. It features a stylized silhouette of a bird, possibly an eagle, with its wings spread, accompanied by the text "DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES · USA" in a circular arc around the bird's head and wings. A horizontal line extends to the right from the "SERVICES" part of the text, separating it from the "Public Health Service" text on the right.

RE: NDA 201739
    AUVI-Q® (epinephrine injection, USP), for intramuscular or subcutaneous use
    MA 1021

Dear Sydney Claud:

The Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (OPDP) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has reviewed the promotional communication, a social media post (post) for AUVI-Q®
(epinephrine injection, USP), for intramuscular or subcutaneous use (Auvi-Q) submitted by
kalea, Inc. (Kaleo) under cover of Form FDA 2253. The Form FDA 2253 submitted by Kaleo
states that “piece CM-US-AQ-3329 will be hosted within piece CM-US-AQ-3336” as a post.¹
The post was made by Brittany Mahomes on her personal Instagram account in “[p]aid
partnership with **auvi-q**” (emphasis original).² This post is false or misleading in that it
presents information about the benefits of Auvi-Q but fails to include any risk information
about the drug. Thus, the post misbrands Auvi-Q within the meaning of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and makes its distribution violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(a),
(n); 321(n); 331(a). See 21 CFR 202.1(e)(5). This violation is concerning from a public health
perspective because it creates a misleading impression about the safety of Auvi-Q, a drug
used to treat patients, including infants and children, with life-threatening allergic reactions
who are at increased risk of adverse outcomes, including death.

**Background**

Below are the indication and summary of the most serious and most common risks
associated with the use of Auvi-Q.³ According to the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section of
the FDA-approved Prescribing Information (PI) (in pertinent part):

              AUVI-Q® is indicated in the emergency treatment of allergic reactions (Type I)
              including anaphylaxis to stinging insects . . . and biting insects . . . allergen
