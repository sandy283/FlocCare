NDA 201739/ MA 1021

                                        immunotherapy, foods, drugs, diagnostic testing substances . . . and other allergens,
                                        as well as idiopathic anaphylaxis or exercise-induced anaphylaxis.

                                        AUVI-Q is intended for immediate administration in patients who are determined to be
                                        at increased risk for anaphylaxis, including individuals with a history of anaphylactic
                                        reactions . . .

                                        AUVI-Q is intended for immediate self-administration as emergency supportive
                                        therapy only and is not a substitute for immediate medical care.

The PI for Auvi-Q includes warnings and precautions regarding emergency treatment,
injection-related complications, serious infections at the injection site, allergic reactions
associated with sulfite, and disease interactions. Common adverse reactions to systemically
administered epinephrine include anxiety, apprehensiveness, restlessness, tremor,
weakness, dizziness, sweating, palpitations, pallor, nausea and vomiting, headache, and
respiratory difficulties.

**False or Misleading Risk Presentation**

Prescription drug advertisements and labeling (promotional communications) misbrand a
drug if they are false or misleading with respect to risk. The determination of whether a
promotional communication is misleading includes, among other things, not only
representations made or suggested in the promotional communication, but also the extent to
which the promotional communication fails to reveal facts material in light of the
representations made or with respect to consequences that may result from the use of the
drug as recommended or suggested in the promotional communication.

The post is misleading because it presents efficacy claims for Auvi-Q but fails to
communicate **any** risk information. For example, the post includes the following claims:
    * “So, I have an infant and a toddler both who have severe food allergies . . . . Based on
      my experience, I can tell you that a severe reaction may not look how you think it
      should look. So, after the diagnosis, a big part of the plan was going to my
      pediatrician, and he did prescribe me Auvi-Q. Auvi-Q is the only epinephrine
      autoinjector out there for infants and toddlers.” (AVO, video portion of post)
    * “AUVI-Q® (epinephrine injection, USP) is for life-threatening allergic emergencies.”
      (SUPER, video portion of post)
    * “[S]haring my experience with [my child's] severe allergic reaction to peanuts . . . .
      partnering with @auvi_q to help spread awareness about severe food allergies in
      young children and how to best respond . . . . AUVI-q 0.1 mg is for infants and toddlers
      16.5-33 lbs.” (text portion of post)

The post, however, entirely omits all risk information. We acknowledge that the post includes
the statement, “For Important Safety Information, visit @auviq_ISI[.]”⁴ However, this does not
mitigate the misleading impression created by the omission of risk information.
_______
⁴ The FDA Form 2253 submitted with the post states, “a link to the indication and important safety information is
provided [within the post].”
