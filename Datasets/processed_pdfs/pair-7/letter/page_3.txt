By omitting the risks associated with Auvi-Q, the post fails to provide material information
about the consequences that may result from the use of Auvi-Q and creates a misleading
impression about the drug's safety.

**Conclusion and Requested Action**

For the reasons discussed above, the post misbrands Auvi-Q within the meaning of the
FD&C Act and makes its distribution violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(a), (n); 321(n); 331(a). See 21
CFR 202.1(e)(5).

This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you with an opportunity to address them.
OPDP requests that Kaleo ceases any violations of the FD&C Act. Please submit a written
response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt, addressing the
concerns described in this letter, listing all promotional communications (with the 2253
submission date) for Auvi-Q that contain representations like those described above, and
explaining your plan for the timely discontinuation of such communications, or for ceasing
distribution of Auvi-Q.

If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, please include in your
submission to us your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration within
15 working days from the date of receipt of this letter.

The concerns discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list of
potential violations. It is your responsibility to ensure compliance with each applicable
requirement of the FD&C Act and FDA implementing regulations.

Please direct your response to the undersigned at the **Food and Drug Administration,**
**Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Office of Prescription Drug Promotion, 5901-**

submitted in response to this letter should be placed under eCTD Heading 1.15.1.6.
