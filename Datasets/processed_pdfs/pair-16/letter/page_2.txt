According to the FDA-approved product labeling (PI):

                 EMGALITY is indicated for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults.

                 EMGALITY is indicated for the treatment of episodic cluster headache in adults.

Emgality is contraindicated in patients with serious hypersensitivity to galcanezumab-gnlm
or to any of its excipients. The PI contains a warning and precaution regarding
hypersensitivity reactions. Cases of anaphylaxis and angioedema have also been reported
in the postmarketing setting. The most common adverse reactions are injection site
reactions.

**False or Misleading Risk Presentation**

Prescription drug advertisements and labeling (promotional communications) misbrand a
drug if they are false or misleading with respect to risk. The determination of whether a
promotional communication is misleading includes, among other things, not only
representations made or suggested in the promotional communication, but also the extent to
which the promotional communication fails to reveal facts material in light of the
representations made or with respect to consequences that may result from the use of the
drug as recommended or suggested in the promotional communication.

The TV ads, which state “brought to you by Emgality proud partner of Team USA,”
(underlined emphasis added) contain claims and/or representations about the use and/or
benefits of Emgality. For example, these TV ads include the following claims:

*   “I do a whole bunch of different things to try to prevent migraine because for me
    the pain is really tough” (Ryan Murphy TV Ad)
*   “I’ve leaned on all kinds of doctors and professionals for help” (Ryan Murphy TV
    Ad)
*   “When I was younger, I used to say that my brain hurt” (Allysa Seely TV Ad)
*   “By the time I was in college, migraine had me hiding from light and sound, it
    was isolating” (Allysa Seely TV Ad)

Because the TV ads contain representations or suggestions relating to an indication for use
of a particular drug product (Emgality), they are required to include information as well.
TV ads for prescription drugs are required to include information relating to the major side
effects and contraindications of the advertised drug in the audio or audio and visual parts of
the presentation and, unless adequate provision is made for dissemination of the approved or
permitted package labeling in connection with the presentation, to contain a brief summary of
all necessary information related to side effects and contraindications.

However, the TV ads fail to communicate **any** risk information about the product. By omitting
the major side effects and contraindications associated with Emgality, the TV ads fail to
provide material information about the consequences that may result from the use of the drug
and create a misleading impression about the drug’s safety. The TV ads also fail to either
provide adequate provision or a brief summary as required by 21 CFR 202.1(e)(1).
