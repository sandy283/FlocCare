**Omission of Material Facts**

The TV ads are misleading because they fail to provide material information regarding
Emgalityâ€™s full FDA-approved indication. Specifically, the INDICATIONS AND USAGE
section of the PI states the following (underlined emphasis added):

EMGALITY is indicated for the _preventive_ treatment of _migraine in adults_.

The Ryan Murphy TV Ad suggests the use of Emgality for the preventive treatment of
migraine, but it does not specify that Emgality is indicated for use in adults. The Allysa Seely
TV Ad suggests the use of Emgality for the treatment of migraine, but it does not specify that
Emgality is indicated for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults. By failing to
adequately communicate the indication for Emgality, the TV ads create a misleading
impression about the drug's FDA-approved indication.

**Failure to Submit Under Form FDA-2253**

FDA regulations require any labeling or advertising devised for promotion of the drug product
to be submitted at the time of initial dissemination of the labeling and at the time of initial
publication of the advertisement for a prescription drug product. Each submission is required
to be accompanied by a completed transmittal Form FDA-2253 (Transmittal of
Advertisements and Promotional Labeling for Drugs for Human Use) and is required to
include a copy of the product's current professional labeling. A copy of each TV ad was not
submitted to OPDP under cover of Form FDA-2253 at the time of initial publication as
required by 21 CFR 314.81(b)(3)(i).

**Conclusion and Requested Action**

For the reasons discussed above, the TV ads misbrand Emgality within the meaning of the
FD&C Act and make its distribution violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(n); 331(a). 21 CFR
202.1(e)(1); (e)(3)(ii); (e)(5). Furthermore, Eli Lilly and Company did not comply with 21 CFR
314.81(b)(3)(i).

This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you with an opportunity to address them.
OPDP requests that Eli Lilly cease any violations of the FD&C Act. Please submit a written
response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt, addressing the
concerns described in this letter, listing all promotional communications (with the 2253
submission date) for Emgality that contain representations like those described above, and
explaining any plan for continuing use of such communications, or for ceasing distribution
of Emgality.

If you believe that your product is not in violation of the FD&C Act, please include in your
submission to us your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration within
15 working days from the date of receipt of this letter.
