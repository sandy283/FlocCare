Lastly, the promotional communication misleadingly implies that the GRAVITY
study represent 12 weeks of treatment with ROSZET. However, this study was not designed
to demonstrate the effect of the combination of rosuvastatin and ezetimibe on LDL-C after 12
weeks of treatment. Rather, patients were first treated with 6 weeks of rosuvastatin 10 mg or
20 mg monotherapy (Weeks 0 to 6) followed by 6 weeks of rosuvastatin plus ezetimibe 10
mg (Weeks 7 to 12). The effects on LDL-C seen at Week 12 are the result of 6 weeks of
monotherapy _followed by_ 6 weeks of combination therapy, _not_ 12 weeks of combination
therapy. Therefore, this study does not support the claimed efficacy of the combination of
rosuvastatin plus ezetimibe after 12 weeks of treatment.

Therefore, due to multiple limitations of design and analytic strategy, these studies do not
support claims and presentations regarding the magnitude of treatment effect of Roszet on
LDL-C.

The claims and presentations regarding Roszet’s effect on LDL-C such as, “**Roszet Delivers
Powerful LDL-C Reductions**” and “**Patients Can Get Below 70 mg/dL with** _**One**_ **Pill
Daily**,” are also misleading because they omit material information from the full indication
about the relative effect of diet (emphasis original). According to the INDICATIONS AND
USAGE section of the PI, one of Roszet’s indications is as an _adjunct_ to diet to reduce LDL-C
in patients with primary non-familial hyperlipidemia. OPDP acknowledges that the full
indication is included at the bottom of page one of the promotional communication. However,
unlike the benefit claims in the promotional communication, which utilize significant white
space and large colorful font, the full indication is included under an “**Important Safety
Information**” header in paragraph format in a much smaller font size and with minimal white
space at the bottom of the page (emphasis original). Therefore, this does not mitigate the
misleading impression. By omitting this information from these claims, this presentation
misleadingly suggests that Roszet alone, in the absence of diet, provides these benefits to
patients with primary non-familial hyperlipidemia when this has not been demonstrated.

**False or Misleading Risk Presentation**

Promotional communication misbrand a drug if they are false or misleading with respect to
risk. The determination of whether a promotional communication is misleading includes,
among other things, not only representations made or suggested in the promotional
communication, but also the extent to which the promotional communication fails to reveal
facts material in light of the representations made or with respect to consequences that may
result from the use of the drug as recommended or suggested in the promotional
communication.

The promotional communication is misleading because it fails to present information relating
to the contraindications and warnings and precautions for Roszet with a prominence and
readability reasonably comparable with the presentation of information relating to the benefits
of Roszet. Factors impacting prominence and readability include typography, layout,
contrast, headlines, paragraphing, white space, and other techniques apt to achieve
