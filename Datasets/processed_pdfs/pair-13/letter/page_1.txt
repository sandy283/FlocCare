RE: NDA 213072
     ROSZET (rosuvastatin and ezetimibe) tablets, for oral use
     MA 4

Dear Dr. Medley:

The Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (OPDP) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has reviewed the promotional communication, a professional “Roszet Doctor Info
Letter Size” (ROS-0009-001) for ROSZET (rosuvastatin and ezetimibe) tablets, for oral use

patients who seek assistance with managing their high cholesterol should receive truthful and
non-misleading information regarding the serious risks and expected benefits associated with
the use of a cholesterol lowering prescription drug product, such as Roszet.
