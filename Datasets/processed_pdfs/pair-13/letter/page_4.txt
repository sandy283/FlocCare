                                            ○ “EXPLORER⁴ Study
                                                ▪ Baseline LDL-C **189 mg/dl** → Final LDL-C **57 mg/dl** after **6 weeks**
                                                  (Dose: rosuvastatin/ezetimibe 40 mg/10 mg)”

These claims and presentations create a misleading impression regarding the efficacy of
Roszet in achieving specific levels of LDL-C reduction over specific periods of time. There
are multiple limitations to the cited studies³˒⁴ that preclude drawing conclusions regarding the
quantitative treatment effect of Roszet on LDL-C based on these studies.

For example, both the GRAVITY and EXPLORER studies conducted analyses in a modified
intent-to-treat population (mITT) that excluded subjects with no post-baseline measurements
from the efficacy analyses and only used the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method
to impute missing data. Both LOCF and mITT introduce bias in the estimation of the
treatment effect and increase the chance of committing a Type I error (i.e., falsely concluding
a treatment effect). The use of the mITT population biases the estimate of the treatment
effect of the drug because excluding patients after randomization could undermine the
integrity of randomization. Similarly, the use of LOCF to account for patients with missing
data further biases the estimate of the treatment effect of the drug because it relies on the
unlikely assumption that outcomes after treatment discontinuation remain constant. Also, the
use of LOCF does not account for the uncertainty of the imputed values for missing data.
Thus, the use of the mITT population and LOCF introduce bias into the study results and limit
the conclusions that can be drawn regarding the quantitative treatment effect based on these
studies.

Additionally, the promotional communication includes claims and presentations that
misleadingly imply that the GRAVITY and EXPLORER studies establish that patients can get
their LDL-C below 70 mg/dL with Roszet. The primary endpoints in GRAVITY and
EXPLORER studies were mean percent reduction in LDL-C from baseline to week 12 and the
proportion of patients who achieved LDL-C <100 mg/dL at week 6, respectively. However,
the proportion of patients achieving LDL-C <70 mg/dL was only one of numerous secondary
endpoints in these studies and, the study publications do not discuss, and the FDA is not
aware of, any methods taken to control for multiplicity testing of secondary endpoints in these
studies. As the number of endpoints analyzed in a single study increases, the likelihood of
making false conclusions about a drug’s effects with respect to one or more of those
endpoints becomes a concern if there is not appropriate adjustment for multiplicity. Basing a
conclusion on an analysis where the risk of false conclusions has not been appropriately
controlled can lead to false or misleading representations regarding a drug’s effects. If you
have information on any methods taken to control for multiplicity testing of secondary
endpoints in these studies, please submit to FDA for review.
