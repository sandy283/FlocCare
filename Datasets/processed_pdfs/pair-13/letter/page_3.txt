STUDIES section of the Roszet PI: 1) a monotherapy study that evaluated rosuvastatin in
patients with hyperlipidemia and 2) a combination study that evaluated ezetimibe added to
ongoing statin therapy in patients with primary hyperlipidemia, known coronary heart disease
or multiple cardiovascular risk factors who were already receiving statin monotherapy, but
who had not met their target LDL-C goal. The LDL-C reductions represented in the claims
above that are attributed to Roszet actually depict numbers that were retrospectively
calculated by combining the results of these two unrelated studies, neither of which evaluated
the specific combination of rosuvastatin and ezetimibe (i.e., Roszet). In fact, rosuvastatin
was not actually one of the statins used in the study of ezetimibe added to ongoing statin
therapy. The LDL-C reductions claimed in the promotional communication for each dose of
Roszet were calculated by taking the percent change from baseline LDL-C reduction
observed in the rosuvastatin monotherapy study and then applying an additional 25% LDL-C
reduction which was observed in the separate ezetimibe added to ongoing statin therapy
study. FDA is not aware of a scientific basis for combining study results in this manner.

Furthermore, these studies differed in patient population and type and dose of statin(s), as
well as duration (i.e., 6 weeks for the rosuvastatin monotherapy study and 8 weeks for the
ezetimibe added to ongoing statin therapy study). Such differences between studies limit the
interpretability of any cross-study comparisons and any analysis combining the results of
these studies. Thus, such an analysis does not support these claims that attribute specific
levels of LDL-C reductions to each dose of Roszet. The clinical studies described in the
Roszet PI and cited in the promotional communication support FDA’s finding of safety and
efficacy of the drug with respect to its labeled indication, involving the reduction of LDL-C in
certain patients, but not in achieving the specific levels of LDL-C reductions claimed. Thus,
the promotional communication creates a misleading impression regarding the effect of
Roszet.

The promotional communication also includes the following claims and presentations
(emphasis original):

*   “Patients Can Get Below 70 mg/dL with **One Pill Daily**”

*   “Mean LDL-C Reductions Achieved in Clinical Trials”

    *   “**GRAVITY³ Study**
        *   Baseline LDL-C **163** mg/dl → Final LDL-C **65** mg/dl after 12 weeks
            (Dose: rosuvastatin/ezetimibe 10 mg/10 mg)
        *   Baseline LDL-C **165** mg/dl → Final LDL-C **59** mg/dl after 12 weeks
            (Dose: rosuvastatin/ezetimibe 20 mg/10 mg)”
