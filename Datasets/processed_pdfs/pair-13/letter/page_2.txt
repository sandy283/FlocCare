homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) to reduce LDL-C.

Roszet is contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis and
in patients with hypersensitivity to rosuvastatin, ezetimibe, or any excipients in Roszet. The
PI for Roszet includes warnings and precautions regarding myopathy and rhabdomyolysis,
immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy, hepatic dysfunction, proteinuria and hematuria,
and increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels. The most common adverse
reactions reported with rosuvastatin were headache, nausea, myalgia, arthralgia, dizziness,
asthenia, constipation, and abdominal pain; and with ezetimibe were upper respiratory tract
infection, diarrhea, arthralgia, sinusitis, pain in extremity, fatigue, and influenza. The most
common adverse reactions reported with ezetimibe co-administered with a statin were
nasopharyngitis, myalgia, upper respiratory tract infection, arthralgia, diarrhea, back pain,
influenza, pain in extremity, and fatigue.

**False or Misleading Claims about Efficacy**

Prescription drug advertisements and labeling (promotional communications) misbrand a
drug if they are false or misleading with respect to efficacy. The determination of whether a
promotional communication is misleading includes, among other things, not only
representations made or suggested in the promotional communication, but also the extent to
which the promotional communication fails to reveal facts material in light of the
representations made or with respect to consequences that may result from the use of the
drug as recommended or suggested in the promotional communication.

The promotional communication includes the following claims (emphasis original):

*   “TOTAL* LDL-C REDUCTIONS
    *   Roszet 10 mg/10 mg **64%**
    *   Roszet 20 mg/10 mg **66%**
    *   Roszet 40 mg/10 mg **72%**”

*   “Roszet 5 mg/10 mg total LDL-C reduction is 59%*.”

These claims about the effect of Roszet, attributing specific levels of LDL-C reductions to the
drug product at various dosages, are misleading. Specifically, as reflected in an asterisked
note on these claims,² the LDL-C reductions claimed in the promotional communication are
not the findings of any study of Roszet. Rather, the analysis used to generate these
percentages combines the results of two separate and unrelated studies from the CLINICAL

---
² The asterisk on the claims cited above refers to a note that states: “*Roszet LDL-C reductions calculated from
baseline. E.g. 64% reduction indicates final LDL-C is at 36% of the original baseline level i.e. (1-52%)*(1-25%)
= 36%. [LDL-C reductions: rosuvastatin 10 mg = 52%; ezetimibe 10 mg = incremental 25% reduction]. Inclusion
of this note does not mitigate the misleading claims given that they are based on a scientifically unsound
analysis as discussed above.
