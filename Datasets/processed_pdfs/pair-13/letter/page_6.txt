emphasis. Specifically, benefit claims for Roszet are presented in conjunction with colorful
graphics and large bolded headlines, with significant white space. However, risk information
regarding some of the contraindications is relegated to the bottom of the first page and the
remaining contraindications and warnings and precautions are presented on a subsequent
page. This risk information is also presented in small font and in paragraph format. We note
that some of the most common adverse reactions are presented in the body of the
promotional communication in table format under the header “**Safety and Tolerability**”
(emphasis original). However, only presenting common adverse reactions associated with
Roszet under this header and relegating the serious risks (i.e., contraindications and
warnings and precautions) to the bottom of the page and subsequent page in small font and
paragraph format creates a misleading impression regarding the risk profile of Roszet. For
example, event rates for myalgia are prominently presented under the header “**Safety and
Tolerability**,” however the warning and precaution for myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is
relegated to the subsequent page in small font and paragraph format (emphasis original).
The overall effect of disclosing risk information in this manner undermines the communication
of risk information and thereby misleadingly minimizes the risks associated with the use of
Roszet.
