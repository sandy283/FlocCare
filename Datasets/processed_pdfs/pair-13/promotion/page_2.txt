**Important Safety Information (continued)**

**Contraindications**: ROSZET is contraindicated in
patients with active liver disease or decompensated
cirrhosis, and hypersensitivity to any component of
this product.
**Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis**: ROSZET may
cause myopathy (muscle pain, tenderness, or weak-
ness with creatine kinase [CK] above ten times the
upper limit of normal) and rhabdomyolysis. Acute
kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare
fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyoly-
sis with statins, including rosuvastatin.
  Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years
or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal im-
pairment, concomitant use with certain other drugs
including other lipid-lowering therapies, and higher
ROSZET dosage; Asian patients on ROSZET may
be at higher risk for myopathy. The myopathy risk
is greater in patients taking ROSZET 40 mg/10 mg
daily compared with lower ROSZET dosages.
  The concomitant use of ROSZET with cyc-
losporine or gemfibrozil is not recommended.
ROSZET dosage modifications are recommended
for patients taking certain anti-viral medications,
darolutamide, and regorafenib. Niacin, fibrates,
and colchicine may also increase the risk of myop-
athy and rhabdomyolysis.
  Discontinue ROSZET if markedly elevated CK
levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or sus-
pected. Muscle symptoms and CK increases may
resolve if ROSZET is discontinued. Instruct patients
to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain,
tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompa-
nied by malaise or fever.
**Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy**: There
have been rare reports of immune-mediated
necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune
myopathy, associated with statin use. IMNM is
characterized by: proximal muscle weakness and
elevated serum creatine kinase, which persist de-
spite discontinuation of statin treatment; positive
anti-HMG CoA reductase antibody; muscle biopsy

showing necrotizing myopathy; and improvement
with immunosuppressive agents. Treatment with
immunosuppressive agents may be required. Con-
sider risk of IMNM carefully prior to initiation of a
different statin. If therapy is initiated with a different
statin, monitor for signs and symptoms of IMNM.
**Hepatic Dysfunction**: Increases in serum transam-
inases have occurred with rosuvastatin. Consider
liver enzyme testing before ROSZET initiation and
thereafter, when clinically indicated. There have
been rare post marketing reports of fatal and
non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins,
including rosuvastatin. Patients who consume
substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a
history of liver disease may be at increased risk for
hepatic injury. If serious hepatic injury with clinical
symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice
occurs, promptly discontinue ROSZET.
**Proteinuria and Hematuria**: Dipstick-positive
proteinuria and microscopic hematuria were ob-
served among rosuvastatin treated patients. These
findings were more frequent in patients taking
rosuvastatin 40 mg, when compared to lower doses
of rosuvastatin or comparator statins, though it
was generally transient and was not associated
with worsening renal function. Although the clini-
cal significance of this finding is unknown, consider
a dose reduction for patients on ROSZET therapy
with unexplained persistent proteinuria and/or
hematuria during routine urinalysis testing.
**HbA1c and Fasting Serum Glucose**: Increases in
HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been
reported with statins, including rosuvastatin. Based
on clinical trial data with rosuvastatin, in some
instances these increases may exceed the threshold
for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.
**Adverse Reactions**: Most frequent adverse reac-
tions (incidence >2% and greater than placebo) for
rosuvastatin in clinical trials are: headache, nausea,
myalgia, asthenia, dizziness, asthenia, constipation,
and abdominal pain. Other adverse reactions

reported in clinical studies were hypersensitivity (in-
cluding rash, pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema)
and pancreatitis. For ezetimibe co-administered
with a statin most frequent adverse reactions
(incidence >2% and greater than statin alone) are
nasopharyngitis, myalgia, upper respiratory tract
infection, arthralgia, diarrhea, back pain, influenza,
pain in extremity, and fatigue. For ezetimibe mono-
therapy most frequent adverse reactions (incidence
>2% and greater than placebo) are upper respiratory
tract infection, diarrhea, arthralgia, sinusitis, pain in
extremity, fatigue and influenza.
  There have been rare post marketing reports of
cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forget-
fulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion)
associated with statin use, including ROSZET.
These cognitive issues have been reported for all
statins. The reports are generally nonserious, and
reversible upon statin discontinuation.

**Drug Interactions**:
Gemfibrozil or Cyclosporin: Avoid concomitant use
with ROSZET.
Antivirals: Avoid concomitant use or adjust dose of
ROSZET.
Darolutamide: Do not exceed ROSZET 5 mg/10 mg
once daily.
Regorafenib: Do not exceed ROSZET 10 mg/10 mg
once daily.
Fenofibrates, Niacin, Colchicine: Consider risks and
benefits of concomitant use with ROSZET.
Warfarin: Obtain INR before ROSZET initiation and
monitor INR during ROSZET initiation or dosage
adjustment.

**Use in Specific Populations**:
Discontinue ROSZET when pregnancy is recog-
nized as it may cause fetal harm. Breastfeeding is
not recommended during treatment with ROSZET.

    Information. Morristown, NJ:
    Althera Pharmaceuticals. In a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
    dose-ranging study, in patients with hyperlipidemia, rosuvastatin given as a
    single daily dose for 6 weeks significantly reduced Total-C, LDL-C, non HDL-C,
    and ApoB across the dose range.

    study in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and known coronary heart
    disease, or multiple cardiovascular risk factors, adding ezetimibe to ongoing
    statin therapy provided an additional 25% mean LDL-C reduction from treat-
    ed baseline (post statin treatment) vs. 4% when adding placebo across all the
    statins studied (p<0.001). LDL-C reductions attributable to ezetimibe were
    generally consistent across all statins studied.

    GRAVITY random random 2014; 232:86-93. In the Gravity study, comparator
    arms were simvastatin +
    ezetimibe 40 mg/10 mg and 80 mg/10 mg which reduced LDL-C by 55% and
    57% respectively. Patients were treated on statin monotherapy for first 6
    weeks before 6 weeks of combination therapy. 833 patients aged ≥ 18 years
    with hypercholesterolemia and history of CV risk were randomized to rosu-

    vastatin 10 or 20 mg with ezetimibe 10 mg vs. simvastatin 40 or 80 mg with
    ezetimibe 10 mg for 12 weeks with patients being on mono-therapy statin
    for the first 6-weeks. Primary end-point was % LDL-C change which was 64%
    for rosuvastatin/ezetimibe 20 mg/10 mg dose (p<0.001 vs sim/eze 40/10 mg
    and 60% for the 10 mg/10 mg dose (p = 0.002 vs sim/
    eze 40/10 mg). Percent LDL-C change for simvastatin/ezetimibe 80/10 mg
    was 57% and was 55% for the 40/10 mg dose. Secondary variables included
    % patients achieving LDL-C <100 mg/dL or <70 mg/dL.

    combination with ezetimibe in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease
    (results from the EXPLORER study). Am J Cardiol 2007; 99:673-80. In the
    Explorer Study, comparator arm was rosuvastatin 40 mg which reduced
    LDL-C by 55%. 469 patients aged ≥ 18 years with hypercholesterolemia and a
    history of CV risk were randomized to rosuvastatin + ezetimibe 40 mg/10 mg
    vs. rosuvastatin 40 mg for a total of 6 weeks. Primary end-point was the
    percentage of patients achieving the LDL cholesterol goal <100 mg/dL at
    week 6. Significantly more patients (94%, p <0.001) achieved the primary
    endpoint with rosuvastatin/ezetimibe 40 mg/10 mg than with rosuvastatin
    alone (79%). More patients achieved the optional goal of <70 mg/dL with
    rosuvastatin/ezetimibe 40 mg/10 mg (80%, p<0.001) than with rosuvastatin
    40 mg (35%). On the secondary variable of % LDL-C change, patients on ro-
    suvastatin/ezetimibe 40 mg/10 mg achieved significantly greater reductions
    (70%, p<0.001) than with rosuvastatin 40 mg (57%).
