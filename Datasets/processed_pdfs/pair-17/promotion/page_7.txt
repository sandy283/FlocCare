**Description of Visual Elements:**

The page displays a user interface, likely for creating or previewing an online advertisement.

*   **Left Panel ("Edit text ad"):** This section appears as a form where users can input details for an ad. It includes fields for:
    *   "Final URL" (with the URL `https://alkindisprinkle.com` entered).
    *   Three "Headline" fields (`Low-strength hydrocortisone`, `No pill splitting or crushing`, `Higher Confidence Dosing`). Each headline field shows a character count (e.g., `27 / 30`, `29 / 30`), indicating the current character usage out of a maximum.
    *   "Display path" fields (`Path 1`, `Path 2`), also showing character counts (`0 / 15` for both), indicating they are currently empty.
    *   Two "Description" fields (`ALKIND! SPRINKLE. Treat Adrenal Insufficiency in kids with strengths as low as 0.5 mg.`, `Accurate, hassle-free hydrocortisone granules for newborns and children.`). These also show character counts (`86 / 90`, `72 / 90`).
    *   Next to most input fields, there is a circular icon with a question mark (`◴`), typically indicating an information or help tooltip.
    *   At the top of this panel, there is a plus sign icon (`+`), which could be used to add more elements or options.

*   **Right Panel ("Mobile" preview):** This section visually represents how the ad would appear on a mobile device.
    *   A prominent graphic of a mobile phone screen is centered, displaying the ad.
    *   The ad content visible on the phone screen includes:
        *   `Ad` label.
        *   The display URL: `www.alkindisprinkle.com`.
        *   Combined headlines: `Low-strength hydrocortisone | No pill splitting or crushing`.
        *   The description text: `ALKIND! SPRINKLE. Treat Adrenal Insufficiency in kids with strengths as low as 0.5 mg. Accurate, hassle-free hydrocortisone granules for newborns and children.`.
    *   Above the mobile phone graphic, there's text `1 of 2 previews` with left (`<`) and right (`>`) arrow icons, suggesting that there are multiple ad preview variations and the user can navigate between them.
    *   Below the mobile phone graphic, there's a explanatory note: "Your ad might not always include all your text. Some shortening may also occur in some formats. You can make sure certain text appears in your ad. Learn more". This note clarifies that the ad might be truncated depending on the display format.

*   **Footer:** At the very bottom left of the page, there is a reference number: `PM-ALK-016-rev0-12/20`. This typically indicates a document or project number, version, and date.
