**False or Misleading Risk Presentation**

Prescription drug advertisements and labeling (promotional communications) misbrand a drug if they
are false or misleading with respect to risk. The determination of whether a promotional
communication is misleading includes, among other things, not only representations made or
suggested in the promotional communication, but also the extent to which the promotional
communication fails to reveal facts material in light of the representations made or with respect to
consequences that may result from the use of the drug as recommended or suggested in the
promotional communication.

The sponsored links are misleading because they present claims and/or representations about the
use and/or benefits for Alkindi Sprinkle but fail to communicate **any** risk information. For example, the
sponsored links present the following claims (emphasis original):

*   "Hydrocortisone Oral Granules I Alkindi Sprinkle Now Available
    Accurate and individualized dosing for infants and children with adrenal insufficiency.
    Strengths as low as 0.5 mg without splitting or manipulation."

*   "Hydrocortisone Oral Granules I Cortisol Replacement Therapy
    ALKINDI SPRINKLE: low-strength hydrocortisone for children with adrenal insufficiency.
    Individualized hydrocortisone dosing with no bitter taste, pill cutting or dissolving."

*   "Alkindi Sprinkle for Kids I Micro-Granular Hydrocortisone
    Alkindi Sprinkle for pediatric adrenal insufficiency; strengths as low as 0.5 mg. No cutting,
    no splitting, just sprinkles for neonates and children <17 years of age."

By omitting the risks associated with Alkindi Sprinkle, the sponsored links fail to provide material
information about the consequences that may result from the use of Alkindi Sprinkle and create a
misleading impression about the drugâ€™s safety.

**Conclusion and Requested Action**

For the reasons discussed above, the sponsored links misbrand Alkindi Sprinkle within the meaning of
the FD&C Act and make its distribution violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(a), (n); 321(n); 331(a). See 21 CFR
202.1(e)(5).
