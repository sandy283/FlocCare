RE:                  NDA 213876
                       ALKINDI® SPRINKLE (hydrocortisone) oral granules
                       MA 13

Dear Ms. Devarakonda:

The Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (OPDP) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
has reviewed the promotional communication, sponsored links¹, for ALKINDI® SPRINKLE
(hydrocortisone) oral granules (Alkindi Sprinkle), submitted by Eton Pharmaceuticals (Eton) under
cover of Form FDA 2253. These sponsored links are false or misleading in that they present
information about the benefits of Alkindi Sprinkle, but fail to include **any** risk information about the
drug. Thus, the sponsored links misbrand Alkindi Sprinkle within the meaning of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and make its distribution violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(a),(n); 321(n);
331(a). See 21 CFR 202.1(e)(5). These violations are especially concerning from a public health
perspective because the promotional communications create a misleading impression about the
safety of Alkindi Sprinkle, a drug that is used in a vulnerable pediatric patient population, and may
cause serious adverse reactions such as adrenal crisis, infections, and growth retardation, among
others.

**Background**

Below are the indication and summary of the most serious and most common risks associated with
the use of Alkindi Sprinkle.²

According to the FDA-approved product labeling (PI)³:

                       ALKINDI SPRINKLE is indicated as replacement therapy in pediatric patients with
                       adrenocortical insufficiency.

Alkindi Sprinkle is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to hydrocortisone or any of the
ingredients in Alkindi Sprinkle. The PI contains warnings and precautions regarding adrenal crisis,
infection, growth retardation, Cushing's Syndrome due to use of excessive doses of corticosteroids,

² This information is for background purposes only and does not necessarily represent the risk information that
should be included in the promotional piece(s) cited in this letter.
³ The version of the Alkindi Sprinkle PI that was submitted to FDA when the piece was disseminated, and the
version referred to in this letter is dated September 2020. Subsequently, a new version of the PI was approved
in June 2021. We note that the current version of the PI, approved in June 2021, includes additional risk
information in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS section.
