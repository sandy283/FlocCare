which it is intended. 21 CFR 201.5. Your webpage describes 11C-Acetate as a useful PET
scan agent for detecting recurrent prostate cancer. This use is one for which a prescription
would be needed because it requires the supervision of a physician and, thus, adequate
directions for lay use cannot be written.

Although 21 CFR 201.115(b) provides an exemption from the adequate directions for use
requirement in section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act if a new drug "complies with section 505(i)
. . and regulations thereunder," your investigational drug fails to do so.² Among the
requirements for the exemption for investigational drugs, 21 CFR 312.7 provides that “[a]
sponsor or investigator, or any person acting on behalf of a sponsor or investigator, shall not
represent in a promotional context that an investigational new drug is safe or effective for the
purposes for which it is under investigation or otherwise promote the drug. This provision is
not intended to restrict the full exchange of scientific information concerning the drug,
including dissemination of scientific findings in scientific or lay media. Rather, its intent is to
restrict promotional claims of safety or effectiveness of the drug for a use for which it is under
investigation and to preclude commercialization of the drug before it is approved for
commercial distribution."

The webpage contains claims and presentations that promote 11C-Acetate as safe and
effective for the purpose for which it is being investigated or otherwise promote the drug,
including the examples that follow (emphasis added). We note that 11C-choline and
fluciclovine F 18 are approved products for PET imaging.

* “11C-choline and 11C-acetate are lipid metabolism PET agents. **Both of these
  agents are useful for detecting recurrent disease after a PSA [prostate-specific
  antigen] relapse.”**

* “Small direct comparison studies of 11C-acetate and 11C-choline have revealed no
  clear clinical differences between these agents, although a few studies have
  **suggested a slightly higher detection rate of local recurrences and small pelvic
  lymph node metastases with 11C-acetate.”**

* “In some patients, the muscle uptake of Axumin [(fluciclovine F 18)] may be so high as
  to render the study non-diagnostic, despite having properly abstained from physical
  activity prior to the scan. Additionally, in a small but significant number of patients,
  interfering urinary excretion is seen. **These factors likely help explain the apparent
  lower performance of this agent compared to 11C-Acetate and Choline.”**

* “The lack of urinary tracer excretion of **11C-Acetate allows visualization** of small and
  subtle lesions in this region, not typically possible with PSMA [prostate-specific
  membrane antigen] based agents.”

* “So far Axumin [(fluciclovine F 18)] (detection rate 68%, 38% false positive) . . . does
  not appear to perform nearly as well as Acetate or Choline (88-90% detection rate and

² 21 CFR 201.100 offers another exemption from the requirement for adequate directions for use for prescription
drugs provided certain requirements are met; however, 11C-Acetate does not fall within that exemption because
it is an investigational new drug for which there is no marketing authorization in the United States.
