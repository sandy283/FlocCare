CONVENTIONAL TYPES OF IMAGING

   Ultrasound has a role in doing prostate biopsies and the placement of radioactive
seeds in primary prostate cancer. It is also useful for evaluating local recurrence
after surgery in patients with an increasing PSA. CT Scans are commonly used for
staging men with newly-diagnosed disease, looking for enlarged lymph nodes in
the pelvis. However, it is inaccurate for detecting cancer in the lymph nodes. If
cancer is present in the nodes, a CT scan only finds it 35% of the time. Prostate
MRI is used for staging, biopsy guidance, surgical planning, radiation planning,
and restaging after PSA relapse. Multi-parametric MRI is being found to be very
helpful for detection and local staging of untreated prostate cancer, to reveal
features such as extra-capsular extension or seminal vesicle invasion, thus helping
to confirm local (organ confined) disease. Additionally, multi-parametric MRI is
emerging as a useful imaging tool for following changes in the prostate gland for
men on active surveillance.

TECHNETIUM-MDP

   Prostate cancer frequently metastasizes to the bone, therefore the mainstay of
imaging for advanced prostate cancer has been technetium-labeled (Tc99)
bisphosphonate bone scintigraphy. Tc99 bone scans are used for initial staging of
intermediate-to-high-risk disease and for restaging after PSA relapse.
Unfortunately, it is not sensitive enough to detect small skeletal metastases. False
positives are common due to interference from non-cancerous arthritic changes
and/or prior trauma.
