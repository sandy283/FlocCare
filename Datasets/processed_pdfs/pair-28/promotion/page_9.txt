Better agents for detecting PSMA have been developed, such as 68gallium-
PSMA-11. Several retrospective studies have indicated a higher diagnostic
efficiency of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT compared to 11C-choline PET. In one study,
for example, with 319 patients with PSA relapse, an overall 82.8% detection rate
was seen. As might be expected, the probability of detecting lesions was
correlated with PSA level. A 50% detection was seen when the PSA was 0.2-0.5,
58.3% detection with a PSA of 0.5-1.0, 71.8% detection with a PSA of 1.0-2.0,
and 93% detection when the PSA was over 2.0.

No PSMA PET agents are yet commercially available, with 68Ga-PSMA-11
under clinical trial investigation in multiple U.S. institutions (e.g. UCSF, UCLA,
and Stanford University). “PSMA” is not one agent however. In addition to
68Ga-PSMA-11, there are many different PSMA-targeting agents in current
development – somewhat of a dizzying array. Each has a different molecular
configuration, requiring study to understand how well they work and how they are
different from each other. Competition for the “best” PSMA agent is likely to be
fierce. Below is a list of some of the agents currently under investigation:

    68Ga-PSMA-11
    68Ga-PSMA-617
    68Ga-PSMA-I&T
    68Ga-PSMA-R2
    68Ga-PSMA-SR6
    68Ga-NODAGA
    68Ga-P16-093
