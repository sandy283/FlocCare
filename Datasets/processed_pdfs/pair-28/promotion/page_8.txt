Overview of PET/CT Imaging in Recurrent Prostate Cancer – Current and Emerging Techniques — DrFabio

An image is present on the page, displaying four medical imaging scans (likely PET/CT) arranged in a 2x2 grid. Each scan shows an axial view of the torso, with a yellow arrow pointing to a specific region of interest.
The top-left image is described as a "Fused Axumin PET/CT", and the top-right image as an "axial Axumin PET".
The bottom two images are from the "same patient after 11C-Acetate PET/CT imaging".

                                                                                               8

                                                        a patient with
                                                        Gleason 4+4=8
                                                        disease, post
                                                        prostatectomy
and salvage radiation two years previously. PSA now rising, 1.1 ng/mL. Fused
Axumin PET/CT on the top left and axial Axumin PET on the top right. The
Axumin study is negative.

Bottom row of same patient after 11C-Acetate PET/CT imaging clearly shows a
metastasis in the body of T5.

PSMA PET/CT SCANS

The prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a transmembrane
glycoprotein that occurs much more commonly in prostate cancer cells compared
to benign prostate tissue. The clinically approved imaging method using PSMA
was ProstaScint. ProstaScint, however, has several limitations. The technique uses
an intact antibody which targets the internal portion of the cell membrane
glycoprotein (PSMA) which requires long circulating times. There is prolonged
blood-pool retention leading to high background signals, low detection rates, and
much lower spatial resolution compared to PET.
