             rate was better than 90%. (Am J Nucl Med Mol Imaging 2017;7(1):1-11) The
             reported detection rate for 11C-choline generally ranges from 42-82% with a PSA
             threshold of 2.0 recommended for optimal imaging. At least one study in 102
             patients has also demonstrated a significant influence of the PSA doubling time
             on 11C-choline with a 93% detection rate noted in a PSA range of 0.67-1.1 ng/
             mL if the PSA doubling rate was under seven months.

             11C has a short half-life of 20 minutes, so 11C-Acetate and Choline are available
             only at sites with cyclotrons capable of producing this agent alongside of the
             imaging facility. This does does limit its availability to specialized centers.

There is an area of increased radiotracer uptake (shown in red/orange) where the prostate would be located, indicated by a yellow arrow. This image is described as showing a small metabolic focus in the left prostate bed.]

                                                    two years previously and now with a
                                                    rising PSA of 0.3 ng/mL.

[Image 2: Another axial PET/CT fusion image of the pelvic region, lower than the first image, showing the iliac vessels. There is an area of increased radiotracer uptake (red/orange) in the left external iliac region, indicated by a yellow arrow. This image is described as showing a small positive left external iliac node.]

                                                    Imaging shows a small metabolic
                                                    focus in the left prostate bed (top
                                                    image) and a small positive left
                                                    external iliac node (lower image). The
                                                    results of the scan changed treatment
plans. Salvage radiation treatment was performed and with the treatment field
extended to include the pelvic lymph nodes.
