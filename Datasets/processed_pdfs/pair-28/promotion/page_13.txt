Overview of PET/CT Imaging in Recurrent Prostate Cancer – Current and Emerging Techniques — DrFabio                                         13

                                         IN SUMMARY

The excitement surrounding the current and emerging PET agents is
appropriately exuberant. Radical breakthroughs are occurring in the area of
imaging, however a fair amount of confusion exists and further research is
needed. There is still no “perfect” imaging methodology with 100% accuracy,
with each of the current agents demonstrating some pros and cons.

Our experience at Phoenix Molecular Imaging has shown 11C-Acetate PET to be
a valuable and accurate tool, providing a better understanding of the location and
extent of local recurrences and distant disease - often leading to changes in
treatment plans.

The recent FDA approval of Auxmin is exciting as its 18F tag makes it more
readily available than 11C tagged agents. So far Axumin (detection rate 68%,
38% false positive) however it does not appear to perform nearly as well as
Acetate or Choline (88-90% detection rate and <10% false positive rate). Given
the predilection for bony metastasis in prostate cancer, the routine addition of NaF
PET/CT studies with Axumin appears prudent in order to help mitigate its much
lower detection rate of bony lesions. Acetate or Choline remain overall much
better choices for imaging.

PSMA-targeted imaging appears to be promising and may provide higher
sensitivity and specificity than other imaging agents to date. There are some
important and practical limitations with PSMA however, as detailed above - lack
of PSMA expression in some cancers, false positives in benign vascular lesions
and inability to fully assess the lower pelvis due to high urinary excretion.
