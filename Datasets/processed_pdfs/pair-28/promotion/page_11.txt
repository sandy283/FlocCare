Overview of PET/CT Imaging in Recurrent Prostate Cancer — Current and Emerging Techniques — DrFabio

    obscures the prostate bed, making detection of locally recurrent lesions and lymph
    nodes in the lower pelvis challenging if not impossible to find – see the example
    below. When we consider that in up to 30% of men with recurrence their cancer is
    located in these regions, false negative PSMAs may have significant negative
    impact on their care. 18F-PSMA-1007 is one of the more recent additions to the
    long list of PSMA agents and is in the early pre-clinical study phase. This agent
    shows less prominent urinary excretion and may have a potential advantage
    compared to other PSMA agents in addressing this issue.

The image is a **Ga68-PSMA-11 PET image**. It displays a medical scan of a
human torso, rendered in grayscale against a black background, with areas
of high tracer activity appearing bright white. Yellow arrows point to
specific bright spots in the lower abdomen/pelvic region, indicating prominent
urinary bladder and ureteral tracer activity.

The text associated with the image describes it as:
                                                Ga68-PSMA-11 PET image in a
                                                patient with Gleason 4+5=9 disease,
                                                post prostatectomy and with a rising
                                                PSA of 1.1 ng/mL.

                                                The PSMA study is negative.
                                                Prominent urinary bladder and ureteral
                                                tracer activity is present (arrows)
                                                which interfere with assessment of the
                                                prostate bed and pelvic lymph nodes.
                                                This study was performed after use of
diuretics, which unfortunately was of little help in clearing the urinary activity.
