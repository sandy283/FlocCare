1.78 ng/mL.

In another clinical trial of 96 patients, a comparison was made between Axumin
and 11C-choline PET. The scans showed equivalent findings 61-77% of the time.
However, this study did not include biopsy confirmation. In a third study
performed in Italy, 89 patients with a rising PSA were studied. The overall cancer
detection rate was 37%. In those patients with a PSA of less than 1.0 ng/mL, the
detection rate was 21%, with a PSA of 1.0-2.0 ng/mL detection was 29%, and
when the PSA was higher than 3.0 the detection rate was 59%. In a more recent
multi-center study of Axumin in 596 patients, the overall detection rate was 68%
with a true positive rate of 62% and false positive rate of 38%
(http://www.jurology.com/article/S0022-5347(16)31518-X/pdf).

We and others have observed that with Axumin, there is typically much higher
muscle and bone marrow background activity than that seen with 11C-Acetate or
Choline. This makes small lesions in the prostate bed and bone difficult to detect
(see examples below). In some patients, the muscle uptake of Axumin may be so
high as to render the study non-diagnostic, despite having properly abstained from
physical activity prior to the scan. Additionally, in a small but significant number
of patients, interfering urinary excretion is seen. These factors likely help explain
the apparent lower performance of this agent compared to 11C-Acetate and
Choline.
