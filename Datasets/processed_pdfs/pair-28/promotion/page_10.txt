A few limitations of PSMA-targeting agents are important to understand. Not all
prostate cancers exhibit PSMA overexpression. In one study, about 8% of patients
with prostate cancer did not show PSMA overexpression. Another study showed
that there can be up to a 25% heterogeneity in expression in PSMA in an
individual, thus in one person some of the cancer will be positive while other
cancer deposits will be missed. Additionally, PSMA ligands are not completely
specific for prostate cancer and several benign lesions such as thyroid adenoma,
Paget’s disease, schwannoma, adrenal adenomas, and several types of vascular
tumors (colon, breast, renal, liver, thyroid) may also exhibit increased PSMA
expression. False positive celiac ganglia activity frequently has been noted in the
upper abdomen. Finally, most PSMA-targeting agents to date are significantly
excreted in the urinary tract and urinary bladder. This is a huge issue as this which
