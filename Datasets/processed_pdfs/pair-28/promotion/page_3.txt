                          SODIUM FLUORIDE (NAF) PET/CT SCANS

         NaF PET/CT is similar to standard bone scans, but uses PET imaging which is
         significantly more sensitive and specific than standard Tc99 (Technetium) bone
         scans. In the PCa recurrent setting, bone lesions as small a 2-3 mm with PSA
         values < 1.0 can be detected. Unlike Tc99m bone scan, arthritic changes and prior
         trauma are much less problematic with NaF PET/CT. Another advantage of NaF
         PET is the shorter scan time, typically less than one hour, compared to 4 hours for
         Tc99.

         11C CHOLINE AND ACETATE PET/CT SCANS

         Prostate cancer cells rely on fatty acid metabolism as their energy source. 11C-
         choline and 11C-acetate are lipid metabolism PET agents. Both of these agents
         are useful for detecting recurrent disease after a PSA relapse. 11C-choline has
         been approved for use at Mayo Clinic. 11C-acetate is available under expanded
         access clinical trials at multiple institutions. Small direct comparison studies of
         11C-acetate and 11C-choline have revealed no clear clinical differences between
         these agents, although a few studies have suggested a slightly higher detection
         rate of local recurrences and small pelvic lymph node metastases with 11C-
         acetate.

         In a large-scale study of 11C-acetate PET/CT imaging in 887 patients with
         relapsing PSA (at Phoenix Molecular Imaging), the overall detection rate of
         recurrent prostate cancer was 88% with a PPV of 91%. A PSA threshold of 1.09
         ng/mL was established for optimal imaging. However, if the PSA was less than
         1.0 ng/mL and the PSA doubling rate was brisk (less than 3 months), the detection
