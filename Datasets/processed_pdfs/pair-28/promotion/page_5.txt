AXUMIN PET/CT SCANNING (18F-FACBC)

Amino acids, such as leucine, methionine, and glutamine, are absorbed into the
cancer cells because of the increased metabolic demands of the growing cancer
cells. The FDA recently approved Axumin (Fluciclovine or 18F-FACBC), which
is a fluorine-18 radiolabeled synthetic leucine amino acid.

CLINICAL TRIALS OF AXUMIN

Scans were performed in 105 patients. The results were checked for accuracy with
biopsy or surgery after the scan. Three independent reviewers analyzed the scan
results. For men who had biopsy confirmation of cancer in the prostate bed, the
true-positive rate ranged from 49-58%. The false positive rates ranged from 16-
30%. For patients who had positive biopsies outside of the prostate bed, the
results were much better, with a true-positive rate of 88-93% and a false-positive
rate of only 7-8%. Optimal detection rates were seen when the PSA was above
