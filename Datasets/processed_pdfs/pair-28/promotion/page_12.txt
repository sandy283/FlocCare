The image below shows a 11C-Acetate PET/CT imaging in the same patient as
the above PSMA example showing axial, sagital and coronal views from left to
right. A metabolic focus can be seen in the prostate bed at the anastomosis site
(arrows). The lack of urinary tracer excretion of 11C-Acetate allows visualization
of small and subtle lesions in this region, not typically possible with PSMA based
agents.

[Image: Three medical imaging scans are displayed side-by-side, likely PET/CT images, showing different anatomical views.
The image on the left is an axial view of the pelvic region, showing the cross-section of a patient's lower abdomen/pelvis. A bright, circular area, indicative of metabolic activity, is visible near the center, specifically in the prostate bed, and is highlighted by a yellow arrow pointing towards it.
The middle image is a sagittal view, showing a side profile of the pelvic region. A similar bright area, representing a metabolic focus in the prostate bed at the anastomosis site, is visible and is also indicated by a yellow arrow pointing to it.
The image on the right is a coronal view, presenting a front-to-back perspective of the pelvic region. Again, a bright metabolic focus is clearly visible in the prostate bed area and is marked by a yellow arrow.
All three images display anatomical structures with varying degrees of brightness/color intensity, suggesting different levels of tracer uptake, with the highlighted areas being particularly active. The overall color scheme is predominantly orange/red and black, typical of fused PET/CT scans.]
