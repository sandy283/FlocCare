RE: BLA 125360
      XEOMIN (incobotulinumtoxinA) for injection, for intramuscular or intraglandular use
      MA 883

Dear Kevin Hanlon:

The Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (OPDP) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has reviewed the promotional communication, "Xeomin Aesthetic Social Media"
(XASM-28) (post) for XEOMIN (incobotulinumtoxinA) for injection, for intramuscular or
intraglandular use (Xeomin). The post was made by both Merz Pharmaceuticals GmbH
(Merz) on the Xeomin Aesthetics Instagram account and Nate Berkus on his personal
Instagram account in "[p]aid partnership with **xeominaesthetic**" (emphasis original).¹ The
post makes false or misleading representations and suggestions about the risks and efficacy
of Xeomin. Thus, the post misbrands Xeomin within the meaning of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and makes its distribution violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(a), (n);
321(n); 331(a). 21 CFR 202.1 (e)(5), (e)(7)(viii). These violations are concerning from a
public health perspective because the promotional communication creates a misleading
impression regarding the safety and effectiveness of Xeomin, a drug with a number of serious
and potentially life-threatening risks, including a boxed warning regarding the risk of distant
spread of toxin effects.

**Background**

Below are the indication and summary of the most serious and most common risks
associated with the use of Xeomin.² According to the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section
of the FDA-approved Prescribing Information (PI)³ (in pertinent part):
