Triferic is not intended for use in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis.

Triferic has not been studied in patients receiving home hemodialysis.

The PI contains warnings and precautions regarding hypersensitivity reactions and iron
laboratory testing. In addition, the PI indicates that the most common adverse reactions
associated with Triferic are headache, peripheral edema, asthenia, AV fistula thrombosis,
urinary tract infection, AV fistula site hemorrhage, pyrexia, fatigue, procedural hypotension,
muscle spasms, pain in extremity, back pain, and dyspnea.

**False or Misleading Risk and Benefit Presentations**

Promotional materials misbrand a drug if they are false or misleading with respect to risk or
benefits. The determination of whether promotional materials are misleading includes,
among other things, not only representations made or suggested in promotional materials,
but also failure to reveal facts that are material in light of the representations made by the
materials or with respect to consequences that may result from the use of the drug as
recommended or suggested in the materials.

The webpage contains claims and/or representations about the benefits of Triferic but fails to
communicate **any** risk information about the product. By omitting the risks associated with
Triferic, the webpage fails to provide material information about the consequences that may
result from the use of the drug and creates a misleading impression about the safety of
Triferic.

The webpage makes claims such as the following:

*   Unlike current nurse IV iron administration, Triferic is seamlessly administered via
    dialysate directly to the bone marrow, delivering iron in a physiologic manner avoiding
    iron storage in the liver or reticuloendothelial system.
*   Triferic improves the effectiveness of iron delivery for the majority of dialysis patients
    and prevents iron induced liver damage, especially for those patients with known
    concomitant liver disease.
*   Released clinical trial data along with real world usage have shown that small,
    frequent doses of Triferic, as compared to the current administration of large,
    infrequent doses of IV iron, is safer and more effective in delivering and maintaining
    optimal iron balance.

These claims are misleading because they suggest Triferic is safer and more effective than
other IV iron replacement products, when this has not been demonstrated. No references
were cited to support these claims, and FDA is not aware of data to support claims that
Triferic is safer or more effective compared to other IV iron replacement products. While we
acknowledge that Triferic is the only FDA-approved iron replacement product administered
via hemodialysate, once inside the blood stream, iron delivered by Triferic is used by the
body in the same manner as other currently approved iron replacement products.
Furthermore, with respect to claims comparing Triferic to other IV iron products regarding iron
storage in the liver, we note that liver iron testing was not performed as part of routine clinical
status testing in the studies supporting the approval of Triferic. These studies were also
