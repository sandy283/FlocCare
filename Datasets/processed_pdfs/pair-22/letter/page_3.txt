neither designed to assess the benefit of Triferic in patients with known concomitant liver
disease nor sized to quantitatively evaluate the risk of hepatotoxicity compared to IV iron. If
you have data to support any of the above claims, please submit such data to FDA.

Omission of Material Facts

In addition, the webpage is misleading because it fails to provide material information
regarding Triferic's full FDA-approved indication, including important limitations of use.
Specifically, the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section of the PI states the following (underlined
emphasis added; bolded emphasis in original):

     TRIFERIC is an iron replacement product indicated for the replacement of iron to
     maintain hemoglobin in adult patients with hemodialysis-dependent chronic kidney
     disease (HDD-CKD).

     Limitation of Use
     Triferic is not intended for use in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis.

     Triferic has not been studied in patients receiving home hemodialysis.

By failing to adequately disclose the full indication and limitations of use associated with
Triferic, the webpage creates a misleading impression about the FDA-approved indication for
Triferic. This is particularly concerning given claims made on the webpage such as “Triferic
improves the effectiveness of iron delivery for the majority of dialysis patients . . .” (emphasis
added). This broad claim suggests that Triferic is indicated for patients receiving any type of
dialysis, when it is not intended for use in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis and its safety
and effectiveness for use in patients receiving home hemodialysis have not been studied.

Conclusion and Requested Action

For the reasons discussed above, the webpage misbrands Triferic within the meaning of the
FD&C Act and makes its distribution violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(a), (n); 321(n); 331(a); see 21
CFR 202.1(e)(3)(ii); 202.1(e)(5).

discussed above. Please submit a written response to this letter on or before December 3,
2019, stating whether you intend to comply with this request, listing all promotional materials

any supporting information for our consideration.
