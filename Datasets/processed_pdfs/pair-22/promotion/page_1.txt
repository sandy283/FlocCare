Product Pipeline                  Triferic
Triferic®                         Rockwell's one-of-a-kind iron maintenance drug, Triferic received FDA approval on
Triferic MOA                      January 24, 2015. While the human body needs iron, free iron is toxic and can cause
Triferic Clinical                 inflammation, infection, oxidative stress, allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, and
Development                       death. Iron must be bound to a protective shell, called a ligand, for safe transportation    TRIFERIC®
Progress                          within the body. Triferic iron is bound to pyrophosphate, an ideal ligand for iron.         ferric pyrophosphate citrate

TRIFERIC®                            • More tightly bound than any other iron – preventing the release of free iron
ferric pyrophosphate citrate         • Is a natural, physiologic chelator of iron
                                     • Is an antioxidant and an inhibitor of vascular and soft tissue calcification


                                     Unlike current nurse IV iron administration, Triferic is seamlessly administered via
                                     dialysate directly to the bone marrow, delivering iron in a physiologic manner avoiding
                                     iron storage in the liver or reticuloendothelial system. Triferic improves the
                                     effectiveness of iron delivery for the majority of dialysis patients and prevents iron
                                     induced liver damage, especially for those patients with known concomitant liver
                                     disease.
