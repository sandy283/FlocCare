Development               within the body. Triferic iron is bound to pyrophosphate, an ideal ligand for iron:
Progress

                                 ‚Ä¢ More tightly bound than any other iron ‚Äì preventing the release of free iron
                                 ‚Ä¢ Is a natural, physiologic chelator of iron
                                 ‚Ä¢ Is an antioxidant and an inhibitor of vascular and soft tissue calcification

                                 Unlike current nurse IV iron administration, Triferic is seamlessly administered via
                                 dialysate directly to the bone marrow, delivering iron in a physiologic manner avoiding
                                 iron storage in the liver or reticuloendothelial system. Triferic improves the
                                 effectiveness of iron delivery for the majority of dialysis patients and prevents iron
                                 induced liver damage, especially for those patients with known concomitant liver
                                 disease.

                                 Triferic is a water-soluble iron salt and infused directly to the blood stream, similar to
                                 the normal physiologic iron uptake from the ingestion of food. Triferic is formulated for
                                 slow, continuous delivery by way of dialysate during every 4-hour dialysis treatment
                                 effectively maintaining hemoglobin levels and iron balance without increasing ferritin
                                 iron stores. Triferic is formulated to replace the 5-7 mg iron that is lost during every
                                 dialysis treatment, providing the body with the iron it needs to form red blood cells and
                                 transport oxygen, improving ESA response. Released clinical trial data along with real
                                 world usage have shown that small, frequent doses of Triferic, as compared to the
                                 current administration of large, infrequent doses of IV iron, is safer and more effective
                                 in delivering and maintaining optimal iron balance.

**Visual Elements Description:**

*   **Top Header Navigation Bar:** A dark blue horizontal bar at the top of the page containing navigation links: "Home", "About Rockwell", "Therapeutic Focus", "Bio-Pharma Development", "Dialysis Products", "Media Center", and "Investors". Some links have a small downward arrow indicating a dropdown menu.
*   **"TRIFERIC" Logo:** Located on the left side of the page, below "Development Progress". It features the stylized word "TRIFERIC" in blue, with a smaller line of text below it that appears to be "ferric pyrophosphate citrate". A small, intricate graphic (possibly a stylized atom or molecule) is to the left of the "TRIFERIC" text.
*   **"PRINT PAGE" Button:** A dark blue rectangular button located in the lower-left section of the main content area. It has the text "PRINT PAGE" in white, accompanied by a white printer icon to its right.
*   **Social Media Icons:** In the lower-right section of the main content area, there are four circular icons with white backgrounds and dark borders, each containing a black letter or symbol representing a social media platform:
    *   A 'g' (likely Google+)
    *   A 'y' (likely Twitter's old logo, though it's more commonly 'x' now)
    *   'in' (LinkedIn)
    *   'f' (Facebook)
*   **"ROCKWELL MEDICAL" Logo (Footer):** Located in the bottom-left of the page, this logo features a circular, stylized design to the left of the text "ROCKWELL" (in large, bold letters) and "MEDICAL" (in smaller letters below "ROCKWELL").
*   **Footer Navigation Links:** A horizontal set of text links in the footer, similar to the top navigation, but without dropdown indicators: "Therapeutic Focus", "Bio-Pharma Development", "Dialysis Products", and "Privacy Policy".
