Pritumumab by Nascent Biotech


Nascent Biotech’s lead product, Pritumumab, a natural human antibody, has been used to treat 250 brain cancer patients.

After 5 years, patients treated with pritumumab have an overall survival rate of 25-30%, compared to 3% standard
therapy, demonstrating antibodies are safe and effective.

The United States Patent Office has issued 11 patents for Pritumumab: 4618577; 4761377; 5093261; 5155036;
5286647; 5589573; 5602027; 6051229; 6051387; 6051693; 6165467.

Pritumumab is a fully natural human IgG antibody that was derived using proprietary technology from a B-cell
isolated from a tumor draining lymph node of a patient with cervical cancer.

The recognized target is ecto-domain vimentin that is expressed on the cell surface of a variety of adenocarcinomas,
including brain cancers and melanoma, but not expressed by normal tissues and cells.

In various Phase II clinical trials in Japan patients with brain cancer treated with pritumumab showed an overall
response rate between 25–30% with several survivors beyond 5-years post-treatment. Toxicities were minimal
suggesting pritumumab is a safe and effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of patients with brain cancer.
