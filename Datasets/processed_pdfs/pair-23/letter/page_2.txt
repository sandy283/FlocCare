**Misbranding of an Investigational Drug**

Under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, a drug shall be deemed to be misbranded unless
its labeling bears adequate directions for use. Under FDA regulations, adequate directions
for use means directions under which the layman can use a drug safely and for the
purposes for which it is intended. 21 CFR 201.5. Your website describes the use of
Pritumumab for treating brain cancer. This use is one for which a prescription would be
needed because it requires the supervision of a physician and, therefore, for which
adequate directions for lay use cannot be written.

Although 21 CFR 201.115(b) provides an exemption from the adequate directions for use
requirement in section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act if a new drug "complies with section
505(i)...and regulations thereunder," your investigational drug fails to do so.³ Among the
requirements for this exemption for investigational drugs, 21 CFR 312.7(a) provides that, "[a]
sponsor or investigator, or any person acting on behalf of a sponsor or investigator, shall not
represent in a promotional context that an investigational new drug is safe or effective for
the purposes for which it is under investigation or otherwise promote the drug. This
provision is not intended to restrict the full exchange of scientific information concerning the
drug, including dissemination of scientific findings in scientific or lay media. Rather, its intent
is to restrict promotional claims of safety or effectiveness of the drug for a use for which it is
under investigation and to preclude commercialization of the drug before it is approved for
commercial distribution."

The website includes claims and presentations that promote Pritumumab as safe and
effective for the purposes for which it is being investigated or otherwise promote the drug,
including the following examples (emphasis added):

*   “Pritumumab has **cured a rare form of brain cancer**”

*   “Delivering human antibodies for the **treatment of cancer**”

*   “After 5 years, patients treated with pritumumab have an overall survival rate of 25-
    30%, compared to 3% standard therapy, **demonstrating antibodies are safe and
    effective**”

The above claims and presentations make numerous conclusory statements which suggest
that Pritumumab has been established as being safe and effective in treating brain cancer.
Because, however, Pritumumab is an investigational new drug, the product’s indication(s),
warnings, precautions, adverse reactions, and dosage and administration have not been
established and are unknown at this time. These claims and presentations are extremely
concerning given the lack of adequate safety and efficacy data for Pritumumab. Similarly,
the suggestion that Pritumumab has established efficacy and has “cured a rare form of brain
cancer” is especially troubling given that brain cancer in general is a disease associated with

---
³ 21 CFR 201.100 offers another exemption from the requirement for adequate directions for use for
prescription drugs provided certain requirements are met; however, Pritumumab does not fall within that
exemption because it is an investigational new drug for which there is no marketing authorization in the United
States.
