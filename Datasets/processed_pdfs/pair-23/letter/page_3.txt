a poor prognosis (i.e., decreased overall survival).

The benefit/risk profile associated with Pritumumab is not currently known. The conclusions
reflected in the above claims create a misleading impression regarding the safety and
effectiveness of the product. These claims are concerning given the seriousness of this
disease and the relatively few available treatment options.

Additionally, we note that the website does not include information to clearly indicate that
Pritumumab is an investigational new drug that has not been approved for commercial
distribution in the United States. In summary, the above cited claims on the website
represent the drug as having an established role in the treatment of brain cancer, when
Pritumumab has not been proven safe and effective within the meaning of the FD&C Act
and has not been approved as a drug under that authority for any use.

**Conclusion and Requested Action**

For the reasons discussed above, Pritumumab is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the
FD&C Act and in violation of section 301(k) of the FD&C Act. The claims on the website are
concerning because they make representations in a promotional context regarding the safety
and efficacy of an investigational new drug that has not been approved by the FDA.

OPDP requests that Nascent immediately cease violating the FD&C Act, as discussed above.
Please submit a written response to this letter on or before November 15, 2019, stating
whether you intend to comply with this request, listing all promotional materials for
Pritumumab that contain violations such as those described above, and explaining your plan
for discontinuing use of such violative materials. If you believe that your products are not in
violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our
consideration.

Please direct your response to the undersigned at the **Food and Drug Administration,**
**Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Office of Prescription Drug Promotion, 5901-**
**B Ammendale Road, Beltsville, Maryland 20705-1266.** A courtesy copy can be sent by
facsimile to (301) 847-8444. To ensure timely delivery of your submissions, please use the
full address above and include a prominent directional notation (e.g., a sticker) to indicate that
the submission is intended for OPDP. Please refer to MA 1 in addition to the IND number in
all future correspondence relating to this particular matter. All correspondence should include
a subject line that clearly identifies the submission as a Response to Untitled Letter.
