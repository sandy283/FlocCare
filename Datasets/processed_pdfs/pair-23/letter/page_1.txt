     MA 1

Dear Dr. Merchant:

The Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (OPDP) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has reviewed Nascent Biotech, Inc.'s (Nascent) website¹ that discusses the
investigational new drug Pritumumab, which is the subject of the above-referenced
investigational new drug application (IND). You are receiving this letter as the authorized
representative of Nascent, the sponsor of Pritumumab. The website represents in a
promotional context that Pritumumab, an investigational new drug, is safe and effective for
the purpose for which it is being investigated or otherwise promotes the drug. As a result,
Pritumumab is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (FD&C Act) and is in violation of section 301(k) of the FD&C Act. The claims on the
website are concerning from a public health perspective (b) (4).

(b) (4)
The statements on the website make conclusory representations in a promotional context
regarding the safety and efficacy of Pritumumab, an investigational new drug, that has not
been approved by the FDA and whose safety and efficacy has not yet been established.

Background

Pritumumab² is an investigational new drug for which there is no marketing authorization in
the United States. (b) (4)
