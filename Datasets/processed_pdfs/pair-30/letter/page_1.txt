RE:     NDA 021166
        EstroGel® 0.06% (estradiol gel) for topical use
        MA 430

Dear Dr. Strang:

The Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (OPDP) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has reviewed a professional EstroGel Sell Sheet-PS (2017-EG-0022) (sell sheet) for
EstroGel® 0.06% (estradiol gel) for topical use (EstroGel) submitted by ASCEND
Therapeutics US, LLC (Ascend) under cover of Form FDA 2253. This sell sheet makes false
or misleading claims and/or representations about the efficacy of EstroGel. As a result, the
sell sheet misbrands EstroGel within the meaning of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic
Act (FD&C Act), and makes distribution of the product violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(a); 331(a);
Cf. 21 CFR 202.1(e)(5); (e)(6)(i); (7)(i). This sell sheet is concerning because it falsely suggests
that EstroGel contains the lowest effective dose of estrogen compared to other estrogen
products when, in fact, there are other FDA-approved products that are available at doses
lower than EstroGel.

Background

Below are the indication and summary of the most serious and most common risks
associated with the use of EstroGel. 1 According to its FDA-approved product labeling (PI),
EstroGel is indicated for the following (emphasis original):

        1.1 Treatment of Moderate to Severe Vasomotor Symptoms [VMS] due to
            Menopause.
        1.2 Treatment of Moderate to Severe Symptoms of Vulvar and Vaginal
            Atrophy [VVA] due to Menopause.
