severe VMS due to menopause and moderate to severe VVA due to menopause compared
to other estrogen therapies, including transdermal estrogen therapies, when this is not the
case. According to the EstroGel PI, the approved dose of EstroGel 0.06% for the treatment
of moderate to severe VMS due to menopause and moderate to severe VVA due to
menopause is 1.25 grams (g) of gel per day, which contains 0.75 milligrams (mg) of estradiol.
However, there are other estrogen products, including other transdermal estrogen therapies,
approved by the FDA for the treatment of moderate to severe VMS due to menopause and
moderate to severe VVA due to menopause that have approved estrogen doses lower than
EstroGel.

The sell sheet cites to an article by Archer et al. to support the above claims. The article
describes the results of two studies, neither of which provide support. The first study is a
phase 3 study comparing 1.5 mg estradiol (2.5 g estradiol gel 0.06%) and 0.75 mg estradiol
(1.25 g estradiol gel 0.06%) to placebo. The second study is a phase 4 study comparing
0.375 mg estradiol (1.25 g estradiol gel 0.03%) and 0.27 mg estradiol (0.9 g estradiol gel
0.03%) to placebo. The authors conclude, in pertinent part, that, "[T]he currently available
0.75 mg estradiol in a transdermal gel is the lowest practical dose of this estrogen therapy in
the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms and vulvar and vaginal atrophy
due to menopause.‚Äù (emphasis added). However, neither EstroGel nor estradiol gel 0.03%
were compared in these studies to other FDA-approved formulations of estrogen (e.g., gels,
transdermal patches, or other oral formulations) at any dose. Therefore, they are not
sufficient to support claims suggesting that the dose of estradiol in EstroGel has been proven
to be the lowest effective dose of estrogen for the treatment of symptomatic postmenopausal
women. Similarly, these studies are not sufficient to support claims suggesting that approved
doses below 0.75 mg of other estrogen products are not effective.
