ESTROGel® 0.06%
(estradiol gel)
The Modern Classic

Provides the lowest, effective dose of
transdermal estrogen therapy to help
meet your patients' treatment goals¹

In the 2017 North American Menopause Society (NAMS) Position Statement, NAMS
recommends first-line treatment of VMS with the most appropriate, often
lowest effective dose, of estrogen therapy consistent with treatment goals²

*   The dose of estradiol in EstroGel has been proven to be the
    lowest effective dose for the treatment of symptomatic
    postmenopausal women¹
*   EstroGel follows cGMP regulations as required by the
    FDA so you can be confident your patients are receiving a
    product regulated for safety and efficacy

*   EstroGel is a non-patch transdermal gel. According to NAMS,
    nonoral routes of administration may offer advantages over oral
    routes by bypassing first-pass hepatic metabolism.²*

*Image: A circular image depicts a hand holding a teal-colored pump bottle (likely the EstroGel product) and dispensing a small amount of white gel onto the palm of another hand. This visual demonstrates the method of applying the transdermal gel.*

2
INDICATIONS
1 COPAY

When you prescribe EstroGel, your patients receive
effective and FDA-approved transdermal therapy for both
moderate to severe VMS and VVA⁺ - all with one copay.³

*No head to head randomly controlled trials have been conducted to validate this supposition.
⁺When prescribing solely for the treatment of moderate to severe vulvar/vaginal atrophy due to menopause, topical vaginal products should be considered.
