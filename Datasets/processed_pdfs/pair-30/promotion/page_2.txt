(estradiol gel)
The Modern Classic

* The only non-patch transdermal estrogen therapy that provides relief of both moderate
  to severe vasomotor symptoms and moderate to severe vulvar/vaginal atrophy due to
  menopause¹
* The long half-life of EstroGel (36 hours) allows steady state to be reached in 3 days²*
* Once steady state is achieved, most women have baseline values of approximately 30 pg/mL,
  a normal physiologic level during the premenopausal follicular phase³

² INDICATIONS
¹ COPAY

† When prescribing solely for the treatment of moderate to severe vulvar/vaginal atrophy due to menopause, topical vaginal products
should be considered.
* Steady state is achieved after the third daily application of a 2.5-g dose of EstroGel (1.25-g on each arm).

                                                                                    Please see full Prescribing Information

IMPORTANT RISK INFORMATION about EstroGel³

WARNING: ENDOMETRIAL CANCER, CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS, BREAST CANCER AND PROBABLE DEMENTIA

There is an increased risk of endometrial cancer in a woman with a uterus who uses unopposed estrogens. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk
of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. Adequate diagnostic measures including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated, should be
undertaken to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed, persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding.

Estrogen-alone therapy should not be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia. The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) estrogen-alone substudy reported increased
risks of stroke and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in postmenopausal women (50 to 79 years of age) during 7.1 years of treatment with daily oral conjugated estrogens (CE) [0.625 mg]-alone,
relative to placebo.

The WHI Memory Study (WHIMS) estrogen-alone ancillary study of WHI reported an increased risk of developing probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age or older during
5.2 years of treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone, relative to placebo. It is unknown whether this finding applies to younger postmenopausal women.

In the absence of comparable data, these risks should be assumed to be similar for other doses of CE and other dosage forms of estrogens. Estrogens with or without progestins should be
prescribed at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman.

Estrogen plus progestin therapy should not be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia. The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported increased risks of
DVT, pulmonary embolism (PE), stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) in postmenopausal women (50 to 79 years of age) during 5.6 years of treatment with daily oral CE (0.625 mg) combined
with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) [2.5 mg], relative to placebo.

The WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI reported an increased risk of developing probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age or older during 4 years of
treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) combined with MPA (2.5 mg), relative to placebo. It is unknown whether this finding applies to younger postmenopausal women.

The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy also demonstrated an increased risk of invasive breast cancer. In the absence of comparable data, these risks should be assumed to be similar for
other doses of CE and other dosage forms of estrogens and progestins.

Estrogens with or without progestins should be prescribed at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman.

EstroGel is contraindicated in women with any of the following conditions: undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding; known, suspected, or history of breast cancer; known or
suspected estrogen-dependent neoplasia; active deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or history of these conditions; active arterial thromboembolic disease, or a history of
these conditions; known anaphylactic reaction or angioedema to EstroGel; known liver impairment or disease; known protein C, protein S, or antithrombin deficiency, or other known
thrombophilic disorders; known or suspected pregnancy.

Increase in the risk of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, gallbladder disease, severe hypercalcemia in patients with breast cancer and bone metastases, visual abnormalities such as retinal
vascular thrombosis, elevated blood pressure, hypertriglyceridemia, hypothyroidism, fluid retention, and hypocalcemia have been reported in patients receiving estrogens.

Estrogens may cause an exacerbation of endometriosis, angioedema in women with hereditary angioedema, asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus
erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions. Use with caution in women with hepatic impairment and/or past history of
cholestatic jaundice, and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued. Moisturizer lotion application 1 hour after EstroGel application significantly increased estradiol
absorption. Alcohol-based gels are flammable. Avoid fire, flame, or smoking until the gel has dried.

In clinical studies, the most commonly reported adverse events for EstroGel were breast pain, headache, and flatulence.
