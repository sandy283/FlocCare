with decreased hepatic glycogen, necrolytic migratory erythema, and hypoglycemia in
patients with glucagonoma. The most common adverse reactions reported with Gvoke were
nausea, vomiting, injection site edema raised 1 mm or greater, and headache in adults; and
nausea, hypoglycemia, vomiting, headache, abdominal pain, hyperglycemia, injection site
discomfort and reaction, and urticaria in pediatric patients.

**False or Misleading Risk Presentation**

Promotional materials misbrand a drug if they are false or misleading with respect to risk.
The determination of whether promotional materials are misleading includes, among other
things, not only representations made or suggested in promotional materials, but also failure
to reveal facts material in light of representations made or with respect to consequences that
may result from the use of the drug as recommended or suggested in the materials.

The TV ad is misleading because it includes efficacy claims for Gvoke but fails to include
important risk information associated with the drug. For example, the TV ad fails to include
the contraindication in patients with a known hypersensitivity to glucagon or to any of the
excipients in Gvoke. In addition, the TV ad fails to include information regarding the warning
and precaution for hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. Specifically, the WARNINGS AND
PRECAUTIONS and the PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION sections of the PI state
the following (underlined emphasis added; bolded emphasis original):

         **5.3 Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions**
         Allergic reactions have been reported with glucagon, these include generalized rash,
         and in some cases anaphylactic shock with breathing difficulties and hypotension . . . .

         **17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION**

         . . .
         Serious Hypersensitivity
         Inform patients that allergic reactions can occur with GVOKE. Advise patients to
         seek immediate medical attention if they experience any symptoms of serious
         hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Moreover, although the TV ad includes the contraindications for pheochromocytoma and
insulinoma, the TV ad fails to include material facts about the consequences that may result
from the use of the drug. According to the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS section of the
PI, Gvoke may stimulate the release of catecholamines from a pheochromocytoma and
cause a dramatic increase in blood pressure and may stimulate exaggerated insulin release
from an insulinoma and cause hypoglycemia. By omitting these serious risks associated
with Gvoke and material facts pertaining to these risks for Gvoke, the TV ad misleadingly
suggests that Gvoke is safer than has been demonstrated.

**False or Misleading Claims about Efficacy**

Promotional materials misbrand a drug if they are false or misleading with respect to efficacy.
