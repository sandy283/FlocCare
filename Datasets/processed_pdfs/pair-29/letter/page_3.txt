Additionally, during the presentation, the sales representative minimized serious, life-
threatening, risks associated with Fycompa. Specifically, while the sales representative
acknowledged the Boxed Warning risk of homicidal ideations and aggressive behavior, the
representative downplayed these risks by suggesting the healthcare practitioners should not
worry about it. Although the members of the audience asked for more information about the
serious psychiatric and behavioral reactions, especially the homicidal ideations, the
representative further downplayed the risk of Fycompa with anecdotal claims regarding the
age of pediatric patients who experienced serious psychiatric and behavioral reactions. To
further downplay this risk, the sales representative also noted that other epilepsy centers
have this drug on formulary and were not concerned about the Boxed Warning. The
presentation minimizes the serious risks associated with Fycompa and misleadingly suggests
the drug is safer than has been demonstrated.

Conclusion and Requested Action

For the reasons discussed above, the presentation described above provides evidence that
Fycompa is intended for new uses for which it lacks approval, and for which its labeling does
not provide adequate directions for use, and minimizes the risks of Fycompa, which renders
Fycompa misbranded within the meaning of the FD&C Act and makes its distribution
violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1); 331(a); see 21 CFR 201.5; 201.100; 201.115; 201.128.

OPDP requests that Eisai immediately cease violating the FD&C Act, as discussed above.
Please submit a written response to this letter on or before October 25, 2018, stating whether
you intend to comply with this request, listing all promotional materials (with the 2253
submission date) for Fycompa that contain violations such as those described above, and
explaining your plan for discontinuing use of such violative materials. If you believe that your
products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting
information for our consideration.
