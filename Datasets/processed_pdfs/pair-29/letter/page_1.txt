RE:     NDA 202834; 208277
           Fycompa® (perampanel) tablets, for oral use, CIII
           Fycompa® (perampanel) oral suspension, CIII
           MA 352; MA 78

Dear Ms. Glavan:

The Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (OPDP) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has become aware of oral statements made by an Eisai Inc. (Eisai) sales
representative on (b) (4) in his capacity as an employee of Eisai. According to a
report submitted as a part of a complaint to the OPDP Bad Ad Program, the statements were
made to healthcare professionals regarding Fycompa® (perampanel) tablets, for oral use,
and oral suspension, CIII (Fycompa). Per the report, the Eisai sales representative made
statements that provide evidence that Fycompa is intended for new uses for which it lacks
approval, and for which its labeling does not provide adequate directions for use. Thus, this
promotional activity misbrands Fycompa in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (FD&C Act), and makes its distribution violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1); 331(a); see 21 CFR
201.5; 201.100; 201.115; 201.128. These statements are especially concerning from a public
health perspective because they misleadingly suggest that Fycompa is safe and effective for
(b) (4). In addition, the sales representative’s
statements are false and misleading because they minimize the serious risks associated with
Fycompa, which bears a Boxed Warning due to serious, life-threatening risks, including
psychiatric and behavioral reactions, as well as numerous warnings.

**Background**

Below are the indications and summary of the most serious and most common risks
associated with the use of Fycompa.¹

According to the FDA-approved product labeling (PI)², Fycompa is indicated for the treatment
of partial-onset seizures (POS) with or without secondarily generalized seizures in patients

¹ This information is for background purposes only and does not necessarily represent the risk information that
should be included in the promotional activity cited in this letter.
² The version of the Fycompa PI referred to in this letter, dated July 2017, is the one that was approved at the
time the promotional activity at issue occurred. However, a new version of the PI was approved on September
27, 2018.
