**Image Description:** This image depicts Serena Williams from the chest up, smiling and looking directly at the viewer. She appears in a black and white filter, wearing a shimmering top. Dominant text overlays the image in white: "MIGRAINE PAIN RELIEF STARTS WITH" followed by a large, prominent blue letter "U". Below this, smaller white text states: "Few people had side effects. Most common side effects were nausea (4%) and sleepiness (3%)." This visual element serves as a key frame from an advertisement, likely emphasizing that migraine relief starts "with you" or "with Ubrelvy", given the 'U' and the context.

Serena stands and looks directly at the crowd. "U" flip animates into position on screen.

SUPER: Few people had side effects. Most common side effects were nausea (4%) and sleepiness (3%).

                                                                **Image Description:** This image also features Serena Williams in a black and white filter, smiling and looking at the viewer, with both hands raised, palms forward, in a gesturing manner. The background is a blurred cityscape at night. Prominent white text overlays the image: "LEARN HOW ABBVIE COULD HELP YOU SAVE ON UBRELVY". Below this, in a larger font, is "YOU COULD PAY AS LITTLE AS" followed by a very large, bold, blue "$0*" indicating a potential cost. Further below, in smaller text, are website and phone number details: "UBRELVY.COM" and "1.844.4UBRELVY". In the bottom left corner, the "abbvie" logo is visible. To the right of the logo, text asks: "Questions about cost? Visit UBRELVY.com/cost". A small asterisked footnote at the bottom right of the image clarifies: "*Not available to all U.S. patients. See Terms, Conditions, and Eligibility Criteria at UBRELVY.com/savings." This image functions as the end card of an advertisement, providing key information about product savings and contact details.

                                                                00:27-00:30
