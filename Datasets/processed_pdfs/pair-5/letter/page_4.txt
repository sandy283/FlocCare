presented in frames one through four preparing to appear on a talk show while experiencing
pain and photophobia from a migraine headache. Immediately after this presentation, a blue
lit path with the Ubrelvy logo appears in frame five. In frame six, Serena Williams is shown
walking down the blue lit path, appearing relaxed and no longer holding her head or
shielding her eyes from the lights that continue to shine overhead. The presentation in frame
six is in conjunction with Serena Williams's VO claim that, "One dose works fast to eliminate
migraine pain" and the accompanying prominent graphic "UBRELVY QUICKLY
ELIMINATES MIGRAINE PAIN." This compelling before-and-after presentation in
conjunction with claims such as, "One dose works fast to eliminate migraine pain" and
"UBRELVY QUICKLY ELIMINATES MIGRAINE PAIN" (emphasis added) misleadingly
suggests that Ubrelvy eliminates migraine pain and symptoms more quickly than was
demonstrated in the clinical trials. According to the CLINICAL STUDIES section of the
Ubrelvy PI, the efficacy of Ubrelvy for the acute treatment of migraine was established in two
clinical trials based on two endpoints: 1) effect on pain freedom at two hours post-dose
(defined as a reduction of moderate or severe headache pain to no pain) and 2) effect on
most bothersome symptom (MBS) (i.e., photophobia, phonophobia, nausea) freedom at two
hours post-dose (defined as the absence of the self-identified MBS), compared to placebo.
In Study 1, 19.2%, 21.2%, and 11.8% of patients achieved pain freedom at 2 hours in the
Ubrelvy 50 mg, Ubrelvy 100 mg, and placebo groups, respectively (7.4%-9.4% difference
from placebo); 38.6%, 37.7%, and 27.8% of patients achieved freedom from MBS in the
Ubrelvy 50 mg, Ubrelvy 100 mg, and placebo groups, respectively (9.9%-10.8% difference
from placebo). In Study 2, 21.8% and 14.3% of patients achieved pain freedom at 2 hours in
the Ubrelvy 50 mg and placebo groups, respectively (7.5% difference from placebo); and
38.9% and 27.4% of patients achieved freedom from MBS in the Ubrelvy 50 mg and
placebo groups, respectively (11.5% difference from placebo). We acknowledge that the
claim, "Some people had pain freedom within 2 hours" appears in a small SUPER on frame
six. However, the SUPER is not sufficient to mitigate this misleading suggestion that Ubrelvy
can eliminate migraine pain and symptoms more quickly than has been demonstrated.⁶

In addition, the claim in frame six of the TV ad that "One dose works fast to eliminate
migraine pain," (emphasis added) misleadingly suggests that all patients who take Ubrelvy
can expect their migraine pain to be eliminated after a single dose of Ubrelvy, when this has
not been demonstrated. As described above, according to the CLINICAL STUDIES section
of the Ubrelvy PI, approximately 19% to 22% of patients achieved pain freedom at two hours
after receiving one dose of Ubrelvy. Conversely, approximately 78% to 81% of patients did
not achieve pain freedom after receiving one dose of Ubrelvy. In addition, according to the
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section of the PI, in pertinent part, "If needed, a second
dose [of Ubrelvy] may be taken at least 2 hours after the initial dose" (emphasis added). We

⁶ We note that the storyboard submitted with the TV ad on FDA Form 2253 states in frame one, "Open in the
afternoon to Serena in a talk show dressing room . . . ." and in frame eight, "In the evening, Serena does a final
check in the mirror . . . "; however, the audience viewing the TV ad is not privy to this information and the TV ad
in the public domain does not portray the passing of time in a manner that is consistent with the description in
the storyboard.

**Visual Elements Description:**
There are no images, diagrams, charts, or tables directly present on this PDF page. The text content, however, extensively describes elements of a television advertisement for Ubrelvy. These described elements include:
*   **Frames of a TV ad:** References to "frames one through four," "frame five," "frame six," and "frame eight" of a TV ad, depicting a narrative progression.
*   **Serena Williams:** Mentioned as appearing in the ad, first experiencing migraine and photophobia, then later "appearing relaxed and no longer holding her head or shielding her eyes."
*   **Ubrelvy logo:** Stated to appear on a "blue lit path" in frame five of the ad.
*   **Voiceover (VO) claim:** Serena Williams's voiceover claim: "One dose works fast to eliminate migraine pain."
*   **Graphic:** A "prominent graphic" that states "UBRELVY QUICKLY ELIMINATES MIGRAINE PAIN."
*   **"SUPER" text:** A "small SUPER" (superimposed text) on frame six which reads "Some people had pain freedom within 2 hours."
