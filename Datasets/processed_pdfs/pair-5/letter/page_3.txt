drug as recommended or suggested in the promotional communication.

The TV ad includes the following claims and presentations (in pertinent part, emphasis
original):

*   Frames one to four:

    *   Serena Williams is in a talk show dressing room when she closes her eyes
        and puts her hand to her head, appearing to experience migraine pain. With
        her hand to her head, she takes a deep breath and starts walking. Serena
        Williams looks down a hallway with glaring lights. She holds up her hand and
        recoils from the light, appearing to shield her eyes.

    *   Serena Williams voiceover (VO): “When migraine strikes, you’re faced with a
        choice. Ride it out with the tradeoffs of treating? Or push through the pain and
        symptoms?”

*   Frames five to seven:

    *   The Ubrelvy logo appears in the backstage hallway and a soft blue path

        packet of Ubrelvy.

    *   Serena Williams VO: “With Ubrelvy, there’s another option. One dose works

    *   SUPER: “**UBRELVY® QUICKLY ELIMINATES MIGRAINE PAIN**”

*   Frames 8 to 14:

    *   Serena Williams is sitting in her dressing room in front of a lighted stage mirror
        talking with another person. She is now seen laughing and smiling. Then the
        blue path appears as she excitedly walks on the blue path through the stage
        curtains and waves to an audience. Serena Williams continues walking on the
        blue path onto a brightly lit talk show stage, smiling and waving to the studio
        audience as they applaud.

    *   Serena Williams VO: “Migraine pain relief starts with U. Ask about Ubrelvy.”

These claims and presentations misleadingly suggest that Ubrelvy provides greater benefits
to patients with acute migraine headache than has been demonstrated. Serena Williams is
