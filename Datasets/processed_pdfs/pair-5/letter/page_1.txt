RE: NDA 211765
    UBRELVY (ubrogepant) tablets, for oral use
    MA 934

Dear Dr. Hill:

The Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (OPDP) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has reviewed the promotional communication, a direct-to-consumer television
advertisement (TV ad), titled “Serena TV :30” (US-UBR-230259) for UBRELVY (ubrogepant)
tablets, for oral use (Ubrelvy) submitted by AbbVie, Inc., under cover of Form FDA 2253.¹ The
TV ad makes false or misleading representations and suggestions about the efficacy of
Ubrelvy. Thus, the TV ad misbrands Ubrelvy within the meaning of the Federal Food, Drug
and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and makes its distribution violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(n); 321(n);
331(a). 21 CFR 202.1(e)(5). These violations are concerning from a public health perspective
because the TV ad, featuring Serena Williams, misleadingly suggests that Ubrelvy will
provide a greater treatment benefit to patients suffering from migraine headache than has
been demonstrated. Migraine headache is one of the most common debilitating neurologic
conditions in the US, with millions of Americans (one out of six Americans) experiencing a
migraine within any 3-month period.² Healthcare providers, patients, and caregivers should
not be misled regarding the benefits that can be expected from acute migraine headache
treatments. Moreover, the use of a celebrity athlete in this TV ad amplifies the misleading
representations and suggestions made and increases the potential for audiences to find the
misleading promotional communication more believable due to the perceived credibility of the
source.³

¹ The Form FDA 2253 submission included the final produced TV ad video as well as a storyboard annotated
with frame numbers. We have referred to those frame numbers in this letter to facilitate communication of our
concerns. The TV ad is also available at https://www.ispot.tv/ad/567Q/ubrelvy-when-migraine-strikes-featuring-
serena-williams (last accessed August 27, 2024).
