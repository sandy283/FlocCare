RE:    BLA 125031
       NEULASTA® (pegfilgrastim) injection, for subcutaneous use
       MA 1706

Dear Dr. Shechter:

The Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (OPDP) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has reviewed the promotional communication, a professional animated banner (USA-
003-80637) for NEULASTA® (pegfilgrastim) injection, for subcutaneous use (Neulasta),
submitted by Amgen Inc. (Amgen) under cover of Form FDA 2253. The FDA Bad Ad
Program also received complaints regarding promotional communications with similar claims
and presentations to the ones discussed in this letter. The banner makes false or misleading
claims and representations about the benefit of Neulasta. Thus, the banner misbrands
Neulasta within the meaning of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and
makes its distribution violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(a), (n); 321(n); 331(a). See 21 CFR
202.1(e)(3)(i); 202.1(e)(5). These violations are concerning from a public health perspective
because this promotional communication's misleading claims could cause healthcare
providers to conclude that Neulasta delivered via the Onpro on-body injector (OBI) is more
effective than Neulasta delivered via prefilled syringe (PFS) or that it is more effective than
FDA-licensed biosimilar pegfilgrastim products, which are only delivered via PFS.

**Background**

Below are the indications and summary of the most serious and most common risks
associated with the use of Neulasta.¹ According to the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section
of the FDA-approved product labeling (PI) (in pertinent part):

       Neulasta is indicated to decrease the incidence of infection, as manifested by febrile
       neutropenia, in patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive
       anti-cancer drugs associated with a clinically significant incidence of febrile
       neutropenia . . .

       <u>Limitations of Use</u>
