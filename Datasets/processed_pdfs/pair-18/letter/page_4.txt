the comparator arm vs. “Neulasta Onpro” and “Onpro.” The use of the proper name (i.e.,
nonproprietary name) of Amgen’s PFS product, on the one hand, and the proprietary name
of its OBI product, on the other, could result in healthcare providers failing to understand
that Amgen’s Neulasta was used in both arms of the study. Healthcare providers could
conclude that a biosimilar pegfilgrastim product delivered via PFS is not as effective as
Amgen’s OBI product (i.e., Neulasta Onpro). As noted above, the study cited is
inadequately designed and precludes the drawing of conclusions regarding the comparative
risk of FN in patients taking Amgen’s pegfilgrastim products depending on delivery method.
It likewise does not support conclusions about any other FDA-licensed pegfilgrastim
products. OPDP notes that frame six of the banner states, less prominently and in smaller
font than the claims and presentations set forth in frames one and two, that the retrospective
study evaluates Neulasta Onpro vs. Neulasta PFS, but this statement is not sufficient to
mitigate the more prominent presentation of Pegfilgrastim PFS vs. Neulasta Onpro and
Onpro.

**Conclusion and Requested Action**

For the reasons discussed above, the banner misbrands Neulasta within the meaning of the
FD&C Act and makes its distribution violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(a), (n); 321(n); 331(a). See 21
CFR 202.1(e)(3)(i); 202.1(e)(5).

This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you with an opportunity to address them.
OPDP requests that Amgen cease any violations of the FD&C Act. Please submit a written
response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt, addressing the
concerns described in this letter, listing all other promotional communications (with the 2253
submission date) for Neulasta that contain representations like those described above, and
explaining any plan for discontinuing use of such communications, or for ceasing distribution
of Neulasta.

If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, please include in your
submission to us your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration within
15 working days from the date of receipt of this letter.

The concerns discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list of
potential violations. It is your responsibility to ensure compliance with each applicable
requirement of the FD&C Act and FDA implementing regulations.

Please direct your response to the undersigned at the **Food and Drug Administration,**
**Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Office of Prescription Drug Promotion, 5901-**
