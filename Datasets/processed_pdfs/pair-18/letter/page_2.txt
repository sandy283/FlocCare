Neulasta is not indicated for the mobilization of peripheral blood progenitor cells for
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Neulasta is contraindicated in patients with a history of serious allergic reactions to human
granulocyte colony-stimulating factors such as pegfilgrastim or filgrastim. The PI for
Neulasta includes warnings and precautions regarding splenic rupture, acute respiratory
distress syndrome, serious allergic reactions, allergies to acrylics, use in patients with sickle
cell disorders, glomerulonephritis, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, capillary leak syndrome,
potential for tumor growth stimulatory effects on malignant cells, myelodysplastic syndrome
(MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in patients with breast and lung cancer in
conjunction with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, potential device failures, and aortitis.
The most common adverse reactions reported with use of Neulasta include bone pain and
pain in extremity.

**False or Misleading Benefit Presentation**

Prescription drug advertisements and labeling (promotional communications) misbrand a
drug if they are false or misleading with respect to benefits. The determination of whether a
promotional communication is misleading includes, among other things, not only
representations made or suggested in the promotional communication, but also the extent to
which the promotional communication fails to reveal facts material in light of the
representations made or with respect to consequences that may result from the use of the
drug as recommended or suggested in the promotional communication.

The banner includes the following claims and presentations (emphasis original):

*   “In a Real-World Study with nearly 11,000 patients Pegfilgrastim PFS resulted in a
    **significantly higher risk of FN vs. Onpro**®” (frame 1)
*   “Across all cycles of chemotherapy, the incidence of FN associated with prefilled
    syringge (PFS) was 1.7% (n = 455) vs 1.3% (n = 126) for Neulasta® Onpro®” (frame 1)
*   A large presentation of an upward arrow containing the claim, “31%* *p = 0.01”
    (frames 1 and 2)
*   “With PFS, **FN incidence increased by 31%** vs Onpro®” (frame 2)

These claims and presentations create a misleading impression regarding the benefit of the
product by stating that there is a statistically significant higher risk of febrile neutropenia
(FN) when pegfilgrastim is administered via the prefilled syringe (PFS) compared to the
Onpro on-body injector (OBI). However, the multiple limitations of the cited study² preclude
the drawing of such conclusions regarding the comparative risk of febrile neutropenia (FN)
in patients taking pegfilgrastim depending on delivery method.

² Data on file, Amgen; 2019 – Delivering pegfilgrastim via PFS (pre-filled syringe) resulted in a significantly
higher risk of FN (febrile neutropenia) vs. Onpro. The data on file was provided by Amgen in response to
OPDP’s request for the information.
