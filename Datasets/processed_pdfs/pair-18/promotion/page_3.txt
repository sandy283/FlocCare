In a Real-World Study with nearly 11,000 patients
Pegfilgrastim PFS resulted in a
significantly higher risk of FN†
vs Onpro®¹
*p=0.01

Across all cycles of
chemotherapy, the incidence
of FN associated with prefilled
syringe (PFS) was 1.7%
(n = 26,455) vs 1.3% (n = 126)
with Neulasta® Onpro®.¹
†FN was defined as:
Inpatient: diagnosis of febrile neutropenia.

Indication and Important Safety Information
Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim) is indicated to decrease
the incidence of infection, as manifested by febrile
neutropenia, in patients with non-myeloid
malignancies receiving myelosuppressive
anti-cancer drugs associated with a clinically

Indication and Important Safety Information
Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim) is indicated to decrease
the incidence of infection, as manifested by febrile
neutropenia, in patients with non-myeloid
malignancies receiving myelosuppressive
anti-cancer drugs associated with a clinically
significant incidence of febrile neutropenia.
• Neulasta® is not indicated for the mobilization of
peripheral blood progenitor cells for hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation.

Important Safety Information
Contraindication
• Neulasta® is contraindicated in patients with a
history of serious allergic reactions to pegfilgrastim
or filgrastim.
• Reactions have included anaphylaxis.

Splenic Rupture
• Splenic rupture, including fatal cases, can occur
following the administration of Neulasta®.
• Evaluate for an enlarged or ruptured spleen in
patients who report left upper abdominal or
shoulder pain.

Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)
• ARDS has occurred in patients receiving
Neulasta®.
• Evaluate patients who develop a fever and lung
infiltrates or respiratory distress after receiving
Neulasta®.
• Discontinue Neulasta® in patients with ARDS.

Serious Allergic Reactions
• Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis,
can occur in patients receiving Neulasta®.
• Majority of events occurred upon initial exposure
and can recur within days after discontinuation of
initial anti-allergic treatment.
• Permanently discontinue Neulasta® in patients
with serious allergic reactions.

Allergies to Acrylics
• On-body injector (OBI) for Neulasta® uses acrylic
adhesives.
• Patients who are allergic to acrylic adhesives
may have a significant reaction.

Use in Patients With Sickle Cell Disorders
• Severe sickle cell crisis, in some cases fatal, can
occur in patients receiving Neulasta®.
• Discontinue Neulasta® if sickle cell crisis occurs.

Glomerulonephritis
• Has occurred in patients receiving Neulasta®.
• Diagnoses based on azotemia, hematuria,
proteinuria, and renal biopsy.
• Generally events resolved after dose reduction or
discontinuation of Neulasta®.
• If suspected, evaluate for cause and if cause is
likely, consider dose-reduction or interruption of
Neulasta®.

Leukocytosis
• Increased white blood cell counts (WBC) of 100 x 10⁹/L
have been observed.
• Monitoring CBCs is recommended.

Capillary Leak Syndrome (CLS)
• CLS has been reported after G-CSF administration,
including Neulasta®.
• Characterized by hypotension, hypoalbuminemia,
edema, and hemoconcentration.
• Episodes vary in frequency, severity, and may be
life-threatening if treatment is delayed.
• Patients with symptoms should be closely
monitored and receive standard symptomatic
treatment, which may include intensive care.

Potential for Tumor Growth Stimulatory Effects
on Malignant Cells
• G-CSF receptor has been found on tumor cell
lines.
• The possibility that pegfilgrastim acts as a
growth factor for any tumor type, including
myeloid malignancies and myelodysplasia,
cannot be excluded.

Potential Device Failures
• Missed or partial doses have been reported in
patients receiving pegfilgrastim via the on-body
injector (OBI) due to the device not performing as
intended.
• In the event of a missed or partial dose, patients
may be at increased risk of events such as
neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and/or infection
than if the dose had been correctly delivered.
• Instruct patients to notify their healthcare
professional immediately in order to determine
the need for a replacement dose of pegfilgrastim
if they suspect that the device may not have
performed as intended. If the patient misses a
dose, a new dose should be administered by
single prefilled syringe for manual use as soon
as possible after detection.

Aortitis
• Aortitis has been reported in patients receiving
Neulasta®. It may occur as early as the first week
after start of therapy.
• Manifestations may include generalized signs
and symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain,
malaise, back pain, and increased inflammatory
markers (e.g., c-reactive protein and white blood
cell count).
• Consider aortitis in patients who develop these
signs and symptoms without known etiology.
Discontinue Neulasta® if aortitis is suspected.

(continued)
Nuclear Imaging
• Increased hematopoietic activity of the bone
marrow in response to growth factor therapy has
been associated with transient positive bone
imaging changes. This should be considered
when interpreting bone imaging results.

Most common adverse reactions
• Bone pain
• Pain in extremity

Information.

Special instructions for the on-body injector
(OBI) for Neulasta®
A healthcare provider must fill the on-body injector
(OBI) with Neulasta® using the co-packaged
prefilled syringe and then apply the OBI to the
patient's skin (abdomen or back of arm). The back
of the arm may only be used if there is a caregiver
available to monitor the status of the OBI.
Approximately 27 hours after the OBI is applied to
the patient's skin, Neulasta® will be delivered over
approximately 45 minutes. A healthcare provider
may initiate administration with the OBI on the
same day as the administration of cytotoxic
chemotherapy, as long as the OBI delivers
Neulasta® no less than 24 hours after the
administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy.
The prefilled syringe co-packaged in the Neulasta®
Onpro® kit contains additional solution to
compensate for liquid loss during delivery through
the OBI. If this syringe is used for manual
subcutaneous injection, the patient will receive an
overdose. If the prefilled syringe for manual use is
used with the OBI, the patient may receive less
than the recommended dose.
Do not use the OBI to deliver any other drug
product except the Neulasta® prefilled syringe co-
packaged with the OBI. Use of the OBI has not
been studied in pediatric patients.
The OBI should be applied to intact, non-irritated
skin on the arm or abdomen.
A missed dose could occur due to an OBI failure or
leakage. Instruct patients using the OBI to notify
their healthcare professional immediately in order
to determine the need for a replacement dose of
pegfilgrastim if they suspect that the device may
not have performed as intended. If the patient
misses a dose, a new dose should be administered
by single prefilled syringe for manual use as soon
as possible after detection.
Review the Patient Information and Patient
Instructions for Use with the patient and provide the
instructions to the patient.
Refer to the Healthcare Provider Instructions for
Use for the OBI for full administration information.
For any OBI problems, call Amgen at
1-800-772-6436 or 1-844-MYNEULASTA
(1-844-696-3852).

Pivotal Trial Study Design and Results²
Phase 3, multicenter, multinational, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of patients with breast cancer (Neulasta® [n = 463]
or placebo [n = 465]) receiving 100 mg/m² docetaxel Q3W for up to 4 cycles. The key endpoint was the percentage of
patients who developed FN (Neulasta® 1% versus placebo 17%, P < 0.001). Also, secondary endpoints were lower for
Neulasta®-treated patients as compared to placebo-treated patients (the incidence of hospitalization due to FN [1% versus 14%] and IV
anti-infective use [2% versus 10%]).
FN = temperature ≥ 38.2°C and absolute neutrophil count < 0.5 x 10⁹/L
Q3W = once every 3 weeks; IV = intravenous.

Indication and Important Safety Information
Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim) is indicated to decrease
the incidence of infection, as manifested by febrile
neutropenia, in patients with non-myeloid
malignancies receiving myelosuppressive
