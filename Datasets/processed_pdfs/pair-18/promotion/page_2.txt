Indication and Important
Safety Information
Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim) is
indicated to decrease the
incidence of infection, as
manifested by febrile
neutropenia, in patients with
non-myeloid malignancies
receiving myelosuppressive
anti-cancer drugs associated
with a clinically significant
incidence of febrile
neutropenia.

Neulasta® is not indicated for
the mobilization of peripheral
blood progenitor cells for
hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation.

Important Safety Information
Contraindication
• Neulasta® is contraindicated
in patients with a history of
serious allergic reactions to
pegfilgrastim or filgrastim.
• Reactions have included
anaphylaxis.

Splenic Rupture
• Splenic rupture, including
fatal cases, can occur
following the administration
of Neulasta®.
• Evaluate for an enlarged or
ruptured spleen in patients
who report left upper
abdominal or shoulder pain.

Acute Respiratory Distress
Syndrome (ARDS)
• ARDS has occurred in
patients receiving Neulasta®.
• Evaluate patients who
develop a fever and lung
infiltrates or respiratory
distress after receiving
Neulasta®.
• Discontinue Neulasta® in
patients with ARDS.

Serious Allergic Reactions
• Serious allergic reactions,
including anaphylaxis can
occur in patients receiving
Neulasta®.
• Majority of events occurred
upon initial exposure and can
recur within days after
discontinuation of initial anti-
allergic treatment.
• Permanently discontinue
Neulasta® in patients with
serious allergic reactions.

Allergies to Acrylics
• On-body injector (OBI) for
Neulasta® uses acrylic
adhesives.
• Patients who are allergic to
acrylic adhesives may have a
significant reaction.

Use in Patients With Sickle
Cell Disorders
• In patients with sickle cell
trait or disease, sickle cell
crisis, in some cases fatal,
can occur in patients
receiving Neulasta®.
• Discontinue Neulasta® if
sickle cell crisis occurs.

Glomerulonephritis
• Has occurred in patients
receiving Neulasta®.
• Diagnoses based on
azotemia, hematuria,
proteinuria, and renal biopsy.
• Generally events resolved
after dose reduction or
discontinuation of Neulasta®.
• If suspected, evaluate for
cause and if cause is likely,
consider dose-reduction or
interruption of Neulasta®.

Leukocytosis
• Increased white blood cell
counts of 100 x 10⁹/L have
been observed.
• Monitoring CBCs is
recommended.

Capillary Leak Syndrome
(CLS)
• CLS has been reported after
G-CSF administration,
including Neulasta®.
• Characterized by
hypotension, hypoalbuminemia,
edema, and hemoconcentration.
• Episodes vary in frequency,
severity, and may be life-
threatening if treatment
is delayed.
• Patients with symptoms
should be closely monitored
and receive standard
treatment, include intensive
care.

Potential for Tumor Growth
Promoting Effects on
Malignant Cells
• G-CSF has been shown to
stimulate in vitro tumor cell lines.
• The possibility that Neulasta®
acts as a growth factor for any
tumor type, including myeloid
malignancies and
myelodysplastic syndrome,
cannot be excluded.

Potential Device Failures
• Missed or partial doses have
been reported in patients
receiving pegfilgrastim via
on-body injector (OBI) due to
a device not performing as
intended.
• In the event of a missed or
partial dose, patients may be
at increased risk of
neutropenia, febrile
neutropenia and/or infection
if the dose had been
incorrectly delivered.
• Instruct patients to notify
their healthcare professional
immediately in order to
determine the need for a
replacement dose if they
suspect that the device may
not have performed as
intended.

Aortitis
• Aortitis has been reported in
patients receiving Neulasta®.
• It may occur as early as the
first week after start of
therapy.
• Manifestations may include
generalized signs and
symptoms such as fever,
abdominal pain, malaise,
back pain, and increased
inflammatory markers (e.g.,
C-reactive protein and white
blood cell count).
• Consider aortitis in patients
who develop these signs and
symptoms without known
etiology. Discontinue
Neulasta® if aortitis is
suspected.

Nuclear Imaging
• Increased hematopoietic
activity of the bone marrow
in response to G-CSF therapy
has been associated with
transient positive bone
imaging changes. This should
be considered when
interpreting bone imaging
results.

Most common adverse
reactions
• Bone pain
• Pain in extremity

Prescribing Information.

Special Instructions for the
on-body injector (OBI) for
Neulasta®
A healthcare provider must fill
the on-body injector (OBI) with
the co-packaged prefilled
syringe and apply the OBI to the
patient's skin (abdomen or
back of arm). The back of the
OBI must be checked by a
caregiver to verify the status of
the OBI. Approximately 27 hours
after the OBI is applied to the
patient's skin, Neulasta® will be
delivered over approximately
45 minutes. A healthcare
provider may initiate
administration with the OBI on
the same day as the
administration of cytotoxic
chemotherapy, as long as the
OBI delivers Neulasta® no less
than 24 hours after the
administration of cytotoxic
chemotherapy.
The prefilled syringe co-
packaged in the Neulasta®
Onpro® kit contains additional
solution to compensate for
liquid loss during delivery
through the OBI. If this syringe
is used for manual
subcutaneous injection, the
patient will receive an
overdose. If the prefilled
syringe for manual use is used
with the OBI, the patient may
receive less than the
recommended dose.
Do not use the OBI to deliver
any other drug product except
the Neulasta® prefilled syringe
co-packaged with the OBI. Use
of the OBI has not been
studied in pediatric patients.
The OBI should be applied to
the intact, non-irritated skin on the
arm or abdomen.

A missed dose could occur due
to an OBI failure or leakage.
Instruct patients using the OBI
to notify their healthcare
professional immediately in
order to determine the need for
a replacement dose of
pegfilgrastim if they suspect
that the device may not have
performed as intended. If the
patient misses a dose, a new
dose should be administered
by single prefilled syringe for
manual use as soon as
possible after detection.

Review the Patient Information
and Patient Instructions for
Use with the patient and
provide the Instructions to the
patient.

Refer to the Healthcare
Provider Instructions for Use
for full
administration information.

Visual Elements Description:

1.  **Animated Banner Frames:** The top section of the page presents five distinct frames of an animated banner, each approximately identical in size and arranged horizontally.
    *   **Frames 1 and 2:** These frames feature a white graphic of an upward-pointing arrow inside a house outline, with "31%*" and "*p = 0.01" beneath it. This visual element represents a statistical increase or positive outcome related to patients staying home. The surrounding text in these frames elaborates on the 31% increase in FN incidence with PFS versus Onpro®.
    *   **Frames 3, 4, and 5:** These frames display the "Neulasta® Onpro® (pegfilgrastim) injection kit" logo. This logo consists of the word "Neulasta" with a registered trademark symbol, followed by "Onpro®" in a stylized box, and then "(pegfilgrastim) injection kit" below it. These frames use the logo to brand the messaging about choosing Neulasta® Onpro® for patient convenience ("Choose Neulasta® Onpro®", "Choose to help avoid next-day visits,", "Choose to let patients stay home.").
    *   All five frames include a consistent footer section with two grey boxes labeled "Prescribing Information" and "Instructions for Use", implying that more detailed information is available there.

2.  **"LEARN MORE" Button:** Located in the "Real-World Study Limitations" section on the upper right side of the page, there is a prominent button with a blue-green gradient background and white text that reads "LEARN MORE". This button serves as a call to action, indicating that further information can be accessed.

3.  **Neulasta® Onpro® Logo (bottom right of ISI section):** Near the bottom of the "Full Scrolling ISI" content, after the copyright information and document number, there is a distinct logo for "Neulasta® Onpro® (pegfilgrastim) injection kit". This is the same logo as seen in banner frames 3, 4, and 5, serving as a branding element for the product.

4.  **AMGEN® Logo and Contact Information:** At the very bottom right of the page, the "AMGEN®" logo is displayed. This is a standard corporate logo, indicating the pharmaceutical company responsible for the product. It is presented above the company's address and website, providing corporate identification and contact details.
