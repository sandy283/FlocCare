had a lot of side effects.”
SUPER: **my switch to LIVALO®**

          Donnie W. Taking LIVALO for 8 years

                       **Robert M.**

VO (:11 - :19): “The first medication I went on came with a lot of side effects, so I tried
other ones after that and it was even worse.”
SUPER: **my switch to LIVALO®**
          Robert M. Switched statins 3 times due to side effects

This presentation misleadingly suggests that Livalo is safer than its competitors by implying
that patients switching to Livalo from other statins will experience a reduction in side effects
compared to other statins, or no side effects at all. While the patient testimonials in this
presentation may be an accurate reflection of these patients' own personal experiences with
Livalo, the testimonials do not adequately support the suggestion in the presentation that
other patients switching to Livalo from other statins will experience a similar reduction in side
effects compared to other statins, or no side effects at all. We note that the video includes a
SUPER during the patient testimonials stating, "Individual results may vary." However, this
does not mitigate the misleading impression from the presentation. FDA is not aware of any
data to support the suggestion that patients switching to Livalo from other statins will
experience a reduction in side effects compared to other statins, or no side effects at all. If
you have data to support this suggestion, please submit them to FDA for review.

The misleading suggestion about Livalo’s side effects is especially concerning given that
Livalo is associated with serious risks, several of which are the **same** as those associated
with other statins. For example, **all statins**, including Livalo, are associated with the serious
risk of skeletal muscle effects. Specifically, the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS section of
the PI for Livalo states the following regarding this risk, “**Cases of myopathy and
rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been
reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including LIVALO®**” (bolded emphasis
original, underlined emphasis added).
