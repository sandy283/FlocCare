Kowa Pharmaceuticals America, Inc.
NDA 022363 MA 609

The video is also misleading because it fails to present information relating to
contraindications, warnings, precautions and adverse reactions for Livalo with a prominence
and readability reasonably comparable with the presentation of information relating to the
benefits of Livalo. Specifically, benefit claims for Livalo are presented prominently as part of
the patient testimonials, which encompass the majority of the screen throughout the video.
However, the risk information is presented as scrolling text relegated to the bottom of the
video during these patient testimonials. The patient testimonials also compete for the
consumers' attention making it difficult for them to adequately process and comprehend the
risk information. The overall effect of disclosing risk information in this manner as scrolling
text relegated to the bottom of the video, along with the simultaneous presentation of the
patient testimonials, undermines the communication of risk information and thereby
misleadingly minimizes the risks associated with the use of Livalo.

**Conclusion and Requested Action**

For the reasons discussed above, the video misbrands Livalo within the meaning of the
FD&C Act and makes its distribution violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(a),(n); 321(n), 331(a). See 21
CFR 202.1(e)(5); 202.1(e)(7)(viii).

OPDP requests that Kowa immediately cease violating the FD&C Act, as discussed above.
Please submit a written response to this letter on or before October 8, 2019, stating whether
you intend to comply with this request, listing all promotional materials (with the 2253

explaining your plan for discontinuing use of such violative materials. If you believe that your
products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting
information for our consideration.

Please direct your response to the undersigned at the **Food and Drug Administration,**
