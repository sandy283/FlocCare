**FOENIX-CCA2: Additional endpoints**

LYTGOBI received accelerated approval from the FDA based on ORR and DoR in a single-arm study¹
* For this reason, a confirmatory study in cholangiocarcinoma is underway¹
* Progression-free survival, overall survival, and disease control rate were prespecified secondary endpoints that were studied in FOENIX-CCA2 and that are not reflected in the full
  Prescribing Information²
* Due to potential variability in the natural history of the disease, a single-arm study may not adequately characterize these time-to-event endpoints and the results may not be interpretable
* This data presentation is neither intended to draw conclusions regarding the efficacy of LYTGOBI nor to imply that there is a treatment effect of LYTGOBI on these time-to-event
  endpoints and the results should be interpreted with caution

**Visual Element 1: Kaplan-Meier curve for Progression-free survival (PFS)**
This is a Kaplan-Meier survival curve titled "Progression-free survival (PFS)²,³".
The main title for the graph is "Kaplan-Meier estimate of PFS (N=103)".
The Y-axis is labeled "Progression-free Survival (%)" and ranges from 0 to 100 in increments of 20.
The X-axis is labeled "Months" and ranges from 0 to 27 in increments of 3.
The curve shows the progression-free survival percentage over time.
The median progression-free survival is stated as "Median, 9.0 mo (95% CI: 6.9, 13.1)".

Below the graph, there is a table showing the number of subjects "At risk" and "Censored" at different time points (months):
|          | 0  | 3  | 6  | 9  | 12 | 15 | 18 | 21 | 24 | 27 |
|----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| At risk  | 103| 79 | 61 | 36 | 19 | 12 | 5  | 1  | 0  |    |
| Censored | -  | 7  | 2  | 11 | 11 | 4  | 2  | 1  | 1  |    |
A footnote below the table states: "Median follow-up at time of data cutoff was 17.1 months".

**Visual Element 2: Kaplan-Meier curve for Overall survival (OS)**
This is a Kaplan-Meier survival curve titled "Overall survival (OS)²,³".
The main title for the graph is "Kaplan-Meier estimate of OS (N=103)".
The Y-axis is labeled "Overall Survival (%)" and ranges from 0 to 100 in increments of 20.
The X-axis is labeled with tick marks at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, representing "Months".
The curve shows the overall survival percentage over time.
The median overall survival is stated as "Median, 21.7 mo (95% CI: 14.5, Not Reached)".
