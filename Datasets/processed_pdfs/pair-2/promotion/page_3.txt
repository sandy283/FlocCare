• At the time of data cutoff: Median follow-up was 17.1 months; the OS data were not mature; during the study, 40 patients (39%) died following treatment
  discontinuation with the majority (90%) dying from disease progression.2,3

Disease control rate (DCR) (n=103)2,3a

There is a circular graphic prominently displayed on the page. Inside the circle, it shows "83% DCR" in large text, with "(95% CI: 74, 89)" underneath. This graphic visually represents the disease control rate and its confidence interval from the study.

• FOENIX-CCA2 was a single-arm study2
• In this setting, the DCR results may reflect the natural history of cholangiocarcinoma in an individual patient, rather than the direct
  effect of treatment

aDCR is the sum of complete response, partial response, and stable disease.

Supplementary results

Efficacy results at extended follow-up

At a nonprespecified follow-up analysis conducted 8 months after the primary analysis (data cutoff, May 29, 2021; median follow-up, 25.0 months), efficacy in the overall study population was maintained
with2,4:
• ORR of 41.7%
• median DoR of 9.5 months
• median PFS of 8.9 months
• median OS of 20.0 months

The extended follow-up data were collected after the primary analysis and are descriptive in nature, and results should be interpreted with caution.

There are three distinct, rectangular white cards/buttons arranged horizontally at the bottom of this section, each appearing to be an interactive element with a small icon and an arrow pointing to the right.
1.  The leftmost card features an icon resembling a clipboard or document with a green checkmark. The text reads: "See how LYTGOBI was studied in a clinical trial".
2.  The middle card features an icon resembling a shield with a green checkmark. The text reads: "View the safety profile of LYTGOBI".
3.  The rightmost card features an icon resembling a pill or capsule. The text reads: "Learn about LYTGOBI dosing".
These elements likely serve as navigation links to other relevant sections or pages for more information.
