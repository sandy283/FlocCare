NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) Recommendations for Cholangiocarcinoma

             Futibatinib (LYTGOBl) is recommended as a National Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®) subsequent-line systemic therapy option for unresectable or metastatic
             intrahepatic or extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements if disease progression5†

                                                         Sample‡ treatment algorithm for subsequent-line use for CCA with *FGFR2* fusions or rearrangements:

*NCCN Category 2A recommendation: based upon lower-level clinical evidence, there is uniform NCCN consensus (>95% support of the Panel) that the intervention is appropriate.
†Treatment selection depends on clinical factors, including previous treatment regimen/agent, somatic molecular testing results, and extent of liver dysfunction.
‡These treatment algorithms are examples only; other treatment options are recommended in the NCCN Guidelines.

**Visual Description:**
The top section features a large, light blue to green gradient background. On the left side, there's a prominent red vertical bar followed by the text "Powered to enable a response". To the right of this text, an abstract image of a white, textured rhino's head and upper body is partially visible, facing right. Below this, there are three rectangular tabs, like a navigation menu, labeled "STUDY DESIGN", "EFFICACY RESULTS", and "SAFETY PROFILE". "EFFICACY RESULTS" is highlighted, suggesting it is the active tab.

Below the top banner, there's a white box containing text and a flowchart. The first part is a header in a blue bar: "NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) Recommendations for Cholangiocarcinoma". Below this, there's a paragraph of text explaining the recommendation for Futibatinib. Following the text, a simplified flowchart illustrates a treatment algorithm. It starts with "Primary Therapy for Unresectable and Metastatic Disease" with a sub-box for "Durvalumab + gemcitabine + cisplatin". An arrow points from this primary therapy towards "Subsequent-Line Therapy if Disease Progression", which has a sub-box for "Futibatinib (LYTGOBl)". Below the flowchart, there are three small footnotes indicated by asterisks and daggers.

LYTGOBl demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 42% in patients with previously treated locally advanced or metastatic iCCA¹

**Visual Description:**
This section, also within a white box, focuses on the overall response rate. It has a header in a blue bar: "LYTGOBl demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 42% in patients with previously treated locally advanced or metastatic iCCA¹".
Below the header, there's a bar chart and a summary box.
On the left, a vertical bar chart shows a Y-axis labeled in percentages from 0% to 100%. A single bar extends up to the 42% mark. Text next to this bar states "N=103 patients", and text within the bar says "ORR: 42%". Below this chart, the text "2.5 months median time to response (range: 0.7-7.4)" is present.
On the right, a separate blue-shaded box is displayed with a green, stylized flower or asterisk icon at the top. Inside this box, the text reads: "The ORR for LYTGOBl was", followed by "42%" in large font, and then "(95% Cl: 32%, 52%)" and "* PR: 42%".

Patients experienced a median duration of response (mDoR) of nearly 10 months with LYTGOBl¹

**Visual Description:**
This final section, contained within a white box, presents data on the duration of response. It has a header in a blue bar: "Patients experienced a median duration of response (mDoR) of nearly 10 months with LYTGOBl¹".
Below the header, there is a horizontal bar chart representing the duration of response in months. The X-axis is labeled "Months" with tick marks at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20.
On the left side of the chart, "Median DoR" is stated, followed by "9.7 Months" in large font and "(95% Cl: 7.6, 17.1)" in smaller font.
The bar chart itself shows a dark blue bar extending from 0 up to approximately 9.7 months. A dotted vertical line marks "Median DoR" at the 9.7-month point. A lighter blue bar continues beyond the dark blue section, extending to the end of the visible chart.
Below the chart, there are two incomplete lines of text with percentages: "72% of responders (n=31) had" and "14% of responders (n=6) had". The rest of the sentences are cut off at the bottom of the page.
