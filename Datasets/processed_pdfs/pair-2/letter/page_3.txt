**False or Misleading Benefit Presentation**

Prescription drug advertisements and labeling (promotional communications) misbrand a
drug if they are false or misleading with respect to benefits. The determination of whether a
promotional communication is misleading includes, among other things, not only
representations made or suggested in the promotional communication, but also the extent to
which the promotional communication fails to reveal facts material in light of the
representations made or with respect to consequences that may result from the use of the
drug as recommended or suggested in the promotional communication.

The “Efficacy Results” webpage, under the “Efficacy & Safety” sub-navigation menu of the
website for Lytgobi, includes the following in conjunction with efficacy representations
regarding PFS and OS (in pertinent part, emphasis original, footnotes omitted):

   - Presentation of a Kaplan-Meier estimate graph of PFS titled, “Progression-free survival
     (PFS),” showing “Progression-free Survival (%)” on the y-axis and “Months” on the x-
     axis

       o “Median [PFS], 9.0 mo (95% CI: 6.9, 13.1)”

       o “Median follow-up at time of data cutoff was 17.1 months”

   - Presentation of a Kaplan-Meier estimate graph of OS titled, “Overall survival (OS),”
     showing “Overall Survival (%)” on the y-axis and “Months” on the x-axis

       o “Median [OS], 21.7 mo (95% CI: 14.5, Not Reached)”

       o “At the time of data cutoff: Median follow-up was 17.1 months; the OS data
         were not mature; during the study, 40 patients (39%) died following treatment
         discontinuation with the majority (90%) dying from disease progression.”

Similarly, the “Efficacy Results” webpage includes the following representations under the
“Supplementary results” bolded header (in pertinent part, emphasis original):

   - “Efficacy results at extended follow-up”

   - “At a nonspecified follow-up analysis conducted 8 months after the primary analysis
     (data cutoff, May 29, 2021; median follow-up, 25.0 months), efficacy in the overall
     study population was maintained with:

     ...

       o “median PFS of 8.9 months”
       o “median OS of 20.0 months”
