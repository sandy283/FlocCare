RE: NDA 214801
LYTGOBI® (futibatinib) tablets, for oral use
MA 89

Dear Chris Jewell:

The Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (OPDP) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has reviewed the promotional communication, the “Efficacy Results” webpage¹
(webpage) on the LYTGOBI® Healthcare Provider Branded Website (FUTI-PM-US-0024 v2)²
(website) for LYTGOBI® (futibatinib) tablets, for oral use (Lytgobi) submitted by Taiho
Oncology, Inc. (Taiho) under cover of Form FDA 2253.

The webpage makes false or misleading representations about the benefits of Lytgobi. Thus,
the webpage misbrands Lytgobi within the meaning of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (FD&C Act) and makes its distribution violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(a), (n); 321(n); 331(a).
See 21 CFR 202.1(e)(5). These violations are particularly concerning because the
promotional communication makes misleading representations about the efficacy of Lytgobi
in patients with previously treated, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) harboring fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene
fusions or other rearrangements. Intrahepatic bile duct cancers have an estimated 5-year
relative survival rate of 9%.³ Unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic iCCA is a serious
public health concern as this unresectable cancer cannot be removed completely by surgery
and treatment for this condition involves serious risks.⁴

Background

Below are the indication and summary of the most serious and most common risks
