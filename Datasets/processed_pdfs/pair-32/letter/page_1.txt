RE:     NDA 020472
          ESTRING® (estradiol vaginal ring)
          MA 275

Dear Dr. Honig:

The Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (OPDP) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has reviewed a direct-to-consumer video of an interview featuring paid and trained
Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) spokespersons regarding ESTRING® (estradiol vaginal ring) (Estring)
posted on the website michiganmomliving.com, as well as the corresponding anchor lead in
questions and answers provided to interview participants (PP-EST-USA-0235) submitted by
Pfizer under cover of Form FDA 2253.¹ This video makes false or misleading claims and/or
representations about the risks associated with and the efficacy of Estring. Thus, the video
misbrands Estring within the meaning of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C
Act), and makes its distribution violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(n); 321(n); 331(a). See 21 CFR
202.1(e)(3)(iii); (e)(5). This video is especially concerning from a public health perspective
because it fails to include any risk information about Estring, which is a drug that bears a
boxed warning due to several serious, life-threatening risks, including endometrial cancer,
breast cancer, and cardiovascular disorders, as well as numerous contraindications and
warnings. The video thus creates a misleading impression about the safety and efficacy of
Estring.

**Background**

Below are the indication and summary of the most serious and most common risks
associated with the use of Estring.² According to the FDA-approved product labeling (PI)³:

ESTRING is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and
vaginal atrophy (VVA) due to menopause.
