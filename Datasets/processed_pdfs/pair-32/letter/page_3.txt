personal experience of an Estring-treated individual such as this spokesperson does not
constitute support for the suggestion that other patients will not experience adverse events
after starting Estring therapy and does not obviate the requirement to present risk
information.

Furthermore, towards the end of the interview, the Physician Spokesperson was asked by the
interviewer, “Is there anything we didn’t cover in this interview?” However, the Physician
Spokesperson declined to take this opportunity to disclose any of the risks of Estring.

**False or Misleading Claims about Efficacy**

In the video, the Patient Spokesperson makes the following claim:

*   “I have to say that it was…yeah once we came up with the plan and I began using the
    product it was pretty much an instant relief.”

This claim misleadingly suggests that patients will experience similar results, i.e., instant relief
of their symptoms, after initiating treatment with Estring. While the Patient Spokesperson's
statement may be an accurate reflection of her own experience as an Estring-treated
individual, the personal experience of an Estring-treated individual such as this spokesperson
does not constitute support for the suggestion that patients will experience instant relief of
their VVA symptoms after starting Estring therapy. Estrogens, including Estring, typically
require an interval of time to improve the signs and symptoms of VVA, and FDA is not aware
of data to support claims that Estring provides instant relief of moderate to severe symptoms
of VVA due to menopause. In studies supporting the approval of Estring, endpoints including
physician's global assessment of vaginal symptoms, patient's global assessment of vaginal
symptoms, physician's assessment of improvement of vaginal mucosa, patient's assessment
of improvement in vaginal dryness, symptoms of dysuria and urinary urgency, vaginal pH,
and maturation index and/or maturation value, were evaluated after 12 weeks of treatment. If
you have data to support the claim that patients using Estring experience instant relief of
moderate to severe symptoms of VVA due to menopause, please submit such data to FDA
for review.

**Conclusion and Requested Action**

For the reasons discussed above, the video misbrands Estring within the meaning of the
FD&C Act, and makes its distribution violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(n); 321(n); 331(a). See 21
CFR 202.1(e)(3)(iii); (e)(5).

OPDP requests that Pfizer immediately cease violating the FD&C Act, as discussed above.
Please submit a written response to this letter on or before July 3, 2018, stating whether you
intend to comply with this request, listing all promotional materials (with the 2253 submission
date) for Estring that contain violations such as those described above, and explaining your
plan for discontinuing use of such violative materials. If you believe that your products are
not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for
our consideration.
