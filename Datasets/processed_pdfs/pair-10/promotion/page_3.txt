How does Phexxi® work?

Vaginas have pH levels that can range from 3.5 to 4.5.

**[Image Description]**: A horizontal pH scale, colored with a gradient from pink (left, labeled "ACIDIC") to blue-green (right, labeled "ALKALINE"). A triangular pointer indicates a range from 3.5 to 4.5, labeled "VAGINAL pH 3.5 - 4.5", positioned in the acidic to neutral portion of the scale. Below the scale, there's a vertical dotted line ending with a small circle, suggesting a process flow.

When semen (sperm) enters the vagina, it raises the vagina's pH level, which allows sperm to be mobile and swim up the reproductive canal.

**[Image Description]**: Following the dotted line, there is an illustration of two stylized sperm, indicating mobility. Another vertical dotted line with a small circle follows.

Phexxi works to keep vaginal pH in the range of 3.5 to 4.5, which lowers sperm mobility, lowering the chance of sperm reaching the egg.

**[Image Description]**: Following the dotted line, there is an illustration of a single stylized sperm with a red 'X' over it, indicating immobility. Another vertical dotted line with a small circle follows.

Phexxi is designed to stay in place during intercourse.

**[Image Description]**: Following the dotted line, there is an illustration of a liquid droplet with a red 'X' over it, indicating no leakage or spillage.

of pregnancies were prevented per act of sex (101 pregnancies over 24,289 acts of sex).

Since Phexxi is an on-demand birth control, during the clinical trial, the effectiveness of Phexxi was also looked at each time Phexxi was used (per act of sex). This means Phexxi prevented pregnancy **99%** of the time.

These data are not found in the Product Information and have not undergone the same rigorous evaluation as other data from the study.

In studies, less than **2%** of women stopped using Phexxi because of side effects.
