Image Description: The page features a central image of a single black foil pouch of Phexxi vaginal gel, diagonally positioned against a light, neutral-colored background. The pouch displays the Phexxi logo and product details: "(lactic acid, citric acid, and potassium bitartrate) Vaginal Gel 1.8%, 1%, 0.4%". It also lists "For Vaginal Use Only", "Each foil pouch contains one pre-filled, single-dose vaginal applicator and one plunger", and "Net contents 5 g".

In the lower left, parts of a teal circular compact or mirror and a makeup brush with an orange handle are shown. In the lower right, a blue pleated clutch purse with gold hardware is visible.
