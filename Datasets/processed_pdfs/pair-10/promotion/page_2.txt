COMPLETE PAGE ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------
The page is visually divided into two main vertical sections: a left section with a reddish-brown and light grey background, and a right section with a solid dark pink/magenta background.

---

**Left Section (Top):**
The upper left portion of the page features a large image of a couple embracing and kissing, with the man holding the woman in his arms. Overlayed on this image, in white text, is the product name and its chemical composition:

phexxí.
(lactic acid, citric acid, and
potassium bitartrate) Vaginal Gel
1.8%, 1%, 0.4%

**Left Section (Middle):**
Below the image, on a light grey background, is prominent text:

No Hormones?
ZERO. ZILCH. NADA. NONE.

**Left Section (Bottom):**
Further down on the light grey background, there's a heading followed by a series of bulleted points, each with a corresponding icon.

**What is Phexxi®?**

Phexxi is an FDA-approved, hormone-free,
prescription vaginal birth control gel that you control.

*   An icon depicting a stylized applicator, suggesting its length.
    Phexxi comes in a 4-inch applicator
    that you use similarly to a tampon

*   An icon showing a box or package with the number "12" on it.
    1 prescription includes 12 individually
    wrapped, single-dose applicators

*   An icon of a bed.
    Phexxi is used right before sex, or up to
    1 hour before sex, and is effective immediately

*   An icon of a Phexxi applicator with a diagonal line through it, possibly indicating another use or a separate instance.
    An additional dose of Phexxi must
    be used before each act of sex

*   An icon of a circular arrow, suggesting reversibility.
    Phexxi is easily reversible, because you
    might want a baby someday, just not now

**Right Section:**
The entire right side of the page is a solid dark pink/magenta color, containing text and another image.

**Phexxi® puts you in control**

Phexxi is quick and easy to use.
Inserting the Phexxi applicator is similar
to inserting a tampon.

When to use Phexxi is simple
to remember:

A visual diagram composed of two connected elements:
*   On the left, a large number "1" inside a pink circle, next to the text "DOSE ACT". This signifies that one dose is one act.
*   On the right, a stylized clock face with the hand pointing towards the 1 o'clock position, next to the text "WORKS IMMEDIATELY UP TO 1 HOUR". This illustrates the immediate effectiveness and duration.
