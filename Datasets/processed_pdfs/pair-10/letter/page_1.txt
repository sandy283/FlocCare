RE: NDA 208352
        PHEXXI (lactic acid, citric acid, and potassium bitartrate) vaginal gel
        MA 176

Dear Dr. Maher:

The Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (OPDP) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has reviewed the promotional communication, a direct-to-consumer brochure, “Digital
Patient Brochure - April 2022” (EVFM-US-001962) (brochure) for PHEXXI (lactic acid, citric
acid, and potassium bitartrate) vaginal gel (Phexxi) submitted by Evofem Biosciences
(Evofem) under cover of Form FDA 2253. The FDA Bad Ad Program also received a
complaint regarding other promotional communications with claims and presentations similar
to those discussed in this letter. This brochure makes false or misleading claims and
representations about the benefits of Phexxi. Thus, the brochure misbrands Phexxi within the
meaning of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and makes its distribution
violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(a), (n); 321(n), 331(a). See 21 CFR 202.1 (e)(5). This violation is
concerning from a public health perspective because it overstates the expected benefits
associated with the use of Phexxi.

**Background**

Below are the indication and summary of the most serious and most common risks
associated with the use of Phexxi.¹ According to the INDICATIONS and USAGE section of
the FDA-approved prescribing information (PI):
