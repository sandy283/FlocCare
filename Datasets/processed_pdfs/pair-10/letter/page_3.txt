cycle study, as 27.5 (95% CI: 22.4%, 33.5%). This Pearl Index value corresponds with a
72.5% cumulative pregnancy prevention rate. The suggestion that Phexxi prevented
pregnancy 99% of the time, in contrast to the pregnancy prevention rates noted in the PI,
overstates the efficacy of the product.

We acknowledge the inclusion of the following statement with these claims, "These data are
not found in the Product Information and have not undergone the same rigorous evaluation
as other data from the study." However, this does not mitigate the misleading overstatement
of efficacy created by these claims.

**Conclusion and Requested Action**

For the reasons discussed above, the brochure misbrands Phexxi within the meaning of the
FD&C Act and makes its distribution violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(a), (n); 321(n); 331(a). See 21
CFR 202.1(e)(5).

This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you with an opportunity to address them.
OPDP requests that Evofem cease any violations of the FD&C Act. Please submit a written
response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt, addressing the
concerns described in this letter, listing all promotional communications (with the 2253

of Phexxi.

If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, please include in your
submission to us your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration within
15 working days from the date of receipt of this letter.

potential violations. It is your responsibility to ensure compliance with each applicable
requirement of the FD&C Act and FDA implementing regulations.
