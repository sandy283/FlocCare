Dear [enter recipient name],

My name is [Name], a representative for Azurity Pharmaceuticals, specializing in pediatric
medicine.

I wanted to let you know that Xatmep® (methotrexate) oral solution is available for your
patients with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. It is also the first and only FDA-approved oral
solution that is available.

Xatmep may benefit your patients:
*   2.5mg/mL provides easy dose titration as body surface area-based dosing is
    recommended.
*   Ready-to-use Oral Solution with a sweet taste.
*   Designed for the patient who is unable to swallow a tablet or has a fear of needles and
    prefers not to receive a shot.
*   Provides patient convenience of being stable with options of being stored at room
    temperature for up to 60 days or refrigerated through the expiration date on the label.

I would like 10 minutes of your time to discuss Xatmep.

Thank you,
