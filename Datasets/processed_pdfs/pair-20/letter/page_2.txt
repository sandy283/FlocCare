Azurity appears to be promoting Xatmep without presenting the
serious risks of the drug in a truthful and non-misleading manner, despite concerns
previously expressed by OPDP.

False or Misleading Risk Presentation

Promotional materials misbrand a drug if they are false or misleading with respect to risk or
benefits. The determination of whether promotional materials are misleading includes,
among other things, not only representations made or suggested in promotional materials,
but also failure to reveal facts material in light of the representations made or with respect to
consequences that may result from the use of the drug as recommended or suggested in
the materials.

The email presents numerous benefit claims regarding Xatmep for the treatment of ALL.
Although the presentation includes the Boxed Warning for Xatmep, the email completely
omits other important warnings and precautions associated with the drug. For example, the
email includes the following claim, “2.5mg/mL provides easy dose titration as body surface
area-based dosing is recommended.” However, the email omits the warning and precaution
regarding the risk of improper dosing. According to the Risk of Improper Dosing subsection
of the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS section of the Xatmep PI:

    Both the physician and pharmacist should emphasize to the patient that the
    recommended dose is taken one time weekly, as directed, and that mistaken daily
    use of the recommended dose has led to fatal toxicity.

In addition, that section warns that a household teaspoon is not an accurate measuring
