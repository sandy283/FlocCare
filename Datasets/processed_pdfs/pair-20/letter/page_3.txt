device and could lead to overdose, which can result in serious adverse reactions.

Furthermore, promotional materials are misleading if they fail to present information about
risks associated with a drug with a prominence and readability reasonably comparable with
the presentation of information relating to the effectiveness of the drug. The email
prominently presents benefit claims for Xatmep in the body of the email in a bulleted list. In
contrast, the limited risk information (i.e., the Boxed Warning) included in the email is
presented after the signature block, which typically signals the close or end of a
correspondence. As such, the email fails to also present the limited risk information
included in the email with a prominence and readability reasonably comparable to the
presentation of information relating to the benefits of the drug.

We note that the email includes the statements, “**For Full Prescribing Information of
Xatmep, please click here: Full Prescribing Information**” and “**For more information on
Xatmep, please click here: Xatmep Website**” (emphasis original). However, this does not
mitigate the email's failure to present the Boxed Warning with sufficient prominence or the
omission of other risk information from the email. By minimizing the Boxed Warning and
omitting the other material information related to the serious risks associated with Xatmep,
the email misleadingly suggests that Xatmep is safer than has been demonstrated.

**False or Misleading Benefit Presentation**

The body of the email presents the following claim for Xatmep:
*   I wanted to let you know that Xatmep® (methotrexate) oral solution is available for
    your patients with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.

This claim is misleading because it fails to adequately communicate the full approved
indication for Xatmep. Specifically, the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section of the PI states
the following (underlined emphasis added):

    XATMEP is indicated for the treatment of **pediatric patients** with acute lymphoblastic
    leukemia (ALL) **as part of a multi-phase, combination chemotherapy maintenance
    regimen.**

This claim is particularly concerning because it suggests the drug is approved for use in
patients of all ages without consideration for the necessity of other treatments as part of a
combination therapy. We acknowledge that the full indication is presented at the bottom of
the email, after the signature block (which, as noted above, typically signifies the end of a
correspondence), the heading “**Important Safety Information**,” and the Boxed Warning
(emphasis original). However, this does not mitigate the misleading impression.

**Conclusion and Requested Action**

For the reasons discussed above, the email misbrands Xatmep within the meaning of the
FD&C Act, and make its distribution violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(a), (n); 321(n); 331(a). See 21
CFR 202.1(e)(3)(i); (e)(5); (e)(7)(viii).
