**Visual Elements Description:**

The page features a dark purple background that transitions subtly from lighter to darker shades. A prominent graphic on the left and center of the page depicts several glowing, light golden-yellow spheres of varying sizes. The largest sphere is centered on the left, with smaller spheres receding into the background towards the upper left. A thin, wavy line, transitioning in color from green to yellow, curves across the lower left part of the image, appearing to originate from or interact with the base of the large sphere. These spheres and lines likely represent the "DETERx microsphere technology" described in the text, illustrating the physical form or concept of the drug's formulation.
