among other things, not only were there representations made or suggested in promotional materials,
but also failure to reveal facts material in light of the representations made or with respect to
consequences that may result from the use of the drug as recommended or suggested in the
materials.

The exhibit booth presentation made representations and/or suggestions about Xtampza ER
but failed to adequately provide material information about the drug’s limitations of use and
the serious and life-threatening consequences that may result from the use of the drug,
thereby creating a misleading impression about the drug’s safety.

Specifically, the exhibit booth presentation included a principal display panel that
prominently presented benefit claims about the abuse-deterrent properties of Xtampza ER,
but failed to include any information with respect to the drug’s limitations of use, which state
that due to the risks of addiction, abuse, misuse, overdose and death, Xtampza ER should
only be used in patients for whom alternative treatment options are ineffective, not tolerated,
or would be otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain. Nor did the
principal display panel include any information with respect to the indication or serious and
life-threatening risks such as those contained in the product’s BOXED WARNING.

We note that the exhibit booth did have a side panel that included information from the
INDICATIONS AND USAGE/LIMITATIONS OF USE, BOXED WARNING,
CONTRAINDICATIONS, and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS sections of the FDA-
approved product labeling. However, as observed by an OPDP representative at the 2017
ASHP Summer Meetings & Exhibition, the side panel was located several feet away from the
principal display panel, and, unlike the principal display panel, which utilized a blue
background and large font size, the side panel utilized a much smaller font size and plain
white background, without any visual elements linking it to the principal display panel.

In addition, the principal display panel prominently presented the following benefit claims for
Xtampza ER at the top of the panel (references omitted):

            With DETERx technology, Xtampza ER

                 …and offers the
                 flexibility of multiple
                 administration options

While these benefit claims regarding Xtampza ER’s abuse-deterrent properties were
prominently presented at eye level and easy to read, material information from the PI
regarding the limitation of such properties in preventing abuse was presented at the bottom
of the panel near the floor. In particular, the bottom of the principal display panel included
the following: “However, abuse of Xtampza ER by injection and by nasal and oral routes of
