administration is still possible by that route but with much less prominence being displayed near the floor,
than the abuse-deterrence benefit claims, an OPDP
representative at the 2017 ASHP Summer Meetings & Exhibition also observed that it was
obscured by a table and chair, such that the material information about the limitations of the
abuse deterrent properties of the product was not visible to viewers as a practical matter.

Presenting material information in this manner is not sufficient to ensure that the claims about
abuse deterrent properties are truthful and non-misleading. The current opioid abuse
epidemic is a critical public health matter. Promotional materials describing abuse-deterrent
properties should specify which routes of abuse deterrence have been established for a
product and for specified routes of administration should adequately present, with sufficient
prominence, additional information to explain that even where abuse-deterrent properties do
exist, these properties only make abuse by such routes more difficult, not impossible.
Furthermore, as stated in the Xtampza ER labeling, opioid drugs with abuse-deterrent
properties still expose users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse.

The exhibit booth presentation described above presents purported benefits of Xtampza ER
but does not adequately present the serious and potentially life-threatening consequences
that may result from use of the product â€” risks that must be adequately and prominently
disclosed in promotional materials for opioid products such as Xtampza ER to ensure that
they are not false or misleading.

**Conclusion and Requested Action**

For the reasons discussed above, the exhibit booth misbrands Xtampza ER within the
meaning of the FD&C Act and makes its distribution violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(a); 321(n);
331(a). Cf. 21 CFR 202.1(e)(3)(ii), (e)(5).

OPDP requests that Collegium immediately cease violating the FD&C Act as discussed
above. Please submit a written response to this letter on or before February 24, 2018, stating
whether you intend to comply with this request, listing all promotional materials (with the 2253
submission date) for Xtampza ER that contain statements such as those described above,
and explaining your plan for discontinuing such violative promotion.

Please direct your response to the undersigned at the **Food and Drug Administration,**
**Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Office of Prescription Drug Promotion, 5901-**
**B Ammendale Road, Beltsville, Maryland 20705-1266.** A courtesy copy can be sent by
facsimile to (301) 847-8444. To ensure timely delivery of your submissions, please use the
full address above and include a prominent directional notation (e.g. a sticker) to indicate that
the submission is intended for OPDP. Please refer to MA 114 in addition to the NDA number
in all future correspondence relating to this particular matter. All correspondence should
include a subject line that clearly identifies the submission as a Response to Untitled Letter.
