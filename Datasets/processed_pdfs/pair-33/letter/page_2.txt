**Limitation of Use**

Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, even at
recommended doses, and because of the greater risks of overdose and death with
extended-release opioid formulations, reserve XTAMPZA ER for use in patients for
whom alternative treatment options (e.g., non-opioid analgesics or immediate-release
opioids) are ineffective, not tolerated, or would be otherwise inadequate to provide
sufficient management of pain.

XTAMPZA ER is not indicated as an as-needed (prn) analgesic.

The prescribing information (PI) for Xtampza ER contains boxed warnings regarding:
addiction, abuse, misuse; life-threatening respiratory depression; accidental ingestion;
neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome; interactions with drugs affecting cytochrome P450
isoenzymes; and risk from concomitant use with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants.
According to the CONTRAINDICATIONS section of the PI, Xtampza ER is contraindicated in
patients with significant respiratory depression; acute or severe bronchial asthma in an
unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment; known or suspected
gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus; and hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis)
to oxycodone. In addition the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS section includes risk
information regarding: life-threatening respiratory depression in patients with chronic
pulmonary disease or in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients; adrenal insufficiency;
severe hypotension; risks of use in patients with increased intracranial pressure, brain
tumors, head injury, or impaired consciousness; risks of use in patients with gastrointestinal
conditions; risk of use in patients with seizure disorders; withdrawal; and risks of driving and
operating machinery. The most common adverse reactions are nausea, headache,
constipation, somnolence, pruritus, vomiting and dizziness.²

**Prior Communications**

OPDP notes that our advisory comments dated September 9, 2016, addressed draft
Collegium presentations for Xtampza ER with certain similarities to the exhibit booth in this
letter. In these advisory comments, OPDP recommended that Collegium revise proposed
presentations so that they did not misrepresent the approved indication or omit important
context; misrepresent or omit important risk information; or omit other material information.
In particular, we cautioned Collegium about failing to present risk information for Xtampza ER
with a prominence and readability reasonably comparable to the presentation of benefits.
We are concerned that Collegium is promoting Xtampza ER in a manner that fails to
adequately present the very serious risks of the drug, despite this direction from OPDP.

**False or Misleading Risk and Benefit Presentations**

Promotional materials misbrand a drug if they are false or misleading with respect to risk or
benefits. The determination of whether promotional materials are misleading includes,

Administration (FDA) on December 16, 2016; the PI applicable to the materials viewed at the American Society
of Health-System Pharmacists Summer Meetings & Exhibit 2017 in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
