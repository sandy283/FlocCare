arterial thromboembolism, vaccination, ophthalmic effects, gastrointestinal perforation,
osteoporosis, myopathy, behavioral and mood disturbances, Kaposi’s sarcoma, use in

and electrolyte disturbances, gastrointestinal, metabolic, musculoskeletal,
neurological/psychiatric, ophthalmic, abnormal fat deposits, decreased resistance to
infection, hiccups, increased or decreased motility and number of spermatozoa, malaise,
moon face, and weight gain.

**False or Misleading Risk Presentation**

Prescription drug advertisements and labeling (promotional communications) misbrand a
drug if they are false or misleading with respect to risk. The determination of whether a
promotional communication is misleading includes, among other things, not only
representations made or suggested in the promotional communication, but also the extent to
which the promotional communication fails to reveal facts material in light of the
representations made or with respect to consequences that may result from the use of the
drug as recommended or suggested in the promotional communication.

The exhibit panel is misleading because it presents efficacy claims for Hemady but fails to
communicate **any** risk information. For example, the exhibit panel includes the following
claims (emphasis original):

* “HEMADY® reduces up to **80%** of the number of tablets required for a therapeutic
  dose of dexamethasone for the treatment of adults with MM” (bolded emphasis
  original).
* “Hemady® is a unique strength dexamethasone tablet bioequivalent to five 4 mg
  tablets of dexamethasone”

The exhibit panel, however, entirely omits all risk information. By omitting the risks associated
with Hemady, the exhibit panel fails to provide material information about the consequences
that may result from the use of Hemady and creates a misleading impression about the
drug’s safety.

**False or Misleading Claims about Efficacy**

Promotional communications misbrand a drug if they are false or misleading with respect to
efficacy. The determination of whether a promotional communication is misleading includes,
among other things, not only representations made or suggested in the promotional
communication, but also the extent to which the promotional communication fails to reveal
facts material in light of the representations made or with respect to consequences that may
result from the use of the drug as recommended or suggested in the promotional
communication.
