Edenbridge Pharmaceuticals, LLC DBA Dexcel Pharma USA
NDA 211379/MA 33

in the dexamethasone group who may have progressed from NDMM to RRMM, the study
protocol did not describe how to prevent double counting of such patients. Given these and
other concerns, the results of the study do not establish improved patient adherence
associated with Hemady relative to generic dexamethasone 4 mg.

Therefore, due to limitations of study design and methodology, the cited study does not
support the claims regarding comparative adherence to Hemady and generic dexamethasone
4 mg among patients with MM.
