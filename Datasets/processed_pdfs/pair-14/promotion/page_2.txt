*Image:* A digital diagram comparing "Skin with Psoriasis" on the left to "Healthy Skin" on the right. Both show a cross-section of skin layers. The "Skin with Psoriasis" depiction shows significantly thicker, more inflamed, and redder layers compared to the "Healthy Skin" side, which appears thinner and more uniform. A red "VS" symbol is placed between the two skin diagrams. In the bottom left corner, there is a pink circular graphic with "The BA" in white text.

*Image:* A sophisticated digital graphic featuring two main elements against a dark blue background with faint grid lines. On the left, a translucent blue outline of a human body is shown, with several glowing orange circular indicators on its left arm, torso, and legs, suggesting areas of a condition. On the right, a side profile of a male head is depicted with various digital overlays, including circles around the ear and eye area, lines, and numerical readouts, suggesting a scan or analysis. The purpose of this visual element seems to illustrate areas affected by psoriasis or a medical analysis.
