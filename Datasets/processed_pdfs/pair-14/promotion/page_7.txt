| One month after stopping treatment with DUOBRII Lotion, 33% of patients were clear or almost clear. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| **Image 1:** A close-up shot of a woman with curly brown hair, wearing a light-colored top. She is looking slightly to her right (viewer's left) with a thoughtful expression, appearing to be speaking. The background is softly blurred, showing an indoor setting with a light source behind her. This image is associated with the testimonial of "Katie". | Katie: When I first started using DUOBRII, I noticed how light and non-greasy it was. Within days, I started to see results. I've been using DUOBRII for 2 years, it works into my routine. I have cleared my plaque psoriasis on my elbow. I didn't have flaky skin, it wasn't sore, it wasn't red. When I have a flare up, I apply it. I don't need to be self-conscious of my plaque psoriasis on my elbow. |
| **Image 2:** A woman (likely Katie) is sitting on a patterned blanket outdoors with two children: a young girl with a black bow in her hair, and a young boy in a striped shirt. The woman is smiling and embracing both children. They appear happy and relaxed. An overlay text is visible on the bottom left of the image, stating: "People with psoriasis may respond to treatments differently and at different times. Individual results may vary." |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

**Image 3:** A woman (likely Katie, from previous images) is standing next to a young man in a dark green graduation cap and gown. She is wearing a striped dress and has her arm around him. Both are smiling and looking at the camera, appearing to be at a graduation event in a large hall or gymnasium, with other people in the blurred background.

**Image 4:** A close-up shot of the same woman (Katie) seated, wearing a light blue top with floral embroidery. She is looking slightly off-camera with a more serious or contemplative expression, possibly mid-sentence. The background is an indoor setting with a blurred lamp and shelving.
