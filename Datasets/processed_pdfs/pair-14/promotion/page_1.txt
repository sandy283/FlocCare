Post hoc analysis of a phase 2 clinical trial
Demonstrated synergy: superior efficacy vs the
aggregated results of two monotherapies³

**Chart/Graph Description:**

The page contains a bar chart titled "Treatment success* at 8 weeks with the effect of vehicle removed³".

The Y-axis is labeled "Patients (%)" and ranges from 0% to 100% in 10% increments.
The X-axis shows two categories: "DUOBRII Lotion" and "Monotherapies aggregated".

*   **DUOBRII Lotion:** A single orange bar shows a treatment success rate of **42.8%**. The percentage "42.8%" is displayed above this bar.
*   **Monotherapies aggregated:** This section is represented by two stacked gray bars.
    *   The upper segment is labeled "8.9% tazarotene".
    *   The lower segment is labeled "23.6% halobetasol".
    *   The total aggregated success rate for monotherapies is **32.5%**, which is displayed above the stacked bars.

Below the chart, there is a button with the text "Study design" and a magnifying glass icon.

**Highlighted Text Box (Right of Chart):**

More patients experienced treatment
success* with DUOBRII Lotion than the
aggregated success rates of both
monotherapies³

**Body Text (Right of Chart):**

DUOBRII Lotion exceeded the clinical definition of
synergy by 31.7% at 8 weeks⁴

Synergy describes when the combined action of two
agents is greater than the sum of the efficacy of the
individual agents⁵

**Footnote (Bottom of Page):**

*Treatment success was defined as at least a 2-grade improvement from baseline in the
IGA score, and a score of "clear" or "almost clear" (primary endpoint at week 8).⁶
