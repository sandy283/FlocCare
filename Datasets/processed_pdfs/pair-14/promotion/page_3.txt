                                                       When I'm diagnosing the severity of
                                                       psoriasis, I look at both the breadth of the
                                                       rash, as well as the scope of the rash.
                                                       Usually a plaque of psoriasis is raised, red,
                                                       and scaly, but the degree of elevation off
                                                       the skin, the degree of redness, the amount
                                                       of scaling helps me determine how severe
                                                       the disease actually is.

-   **MILD:** A silhouette with small red patches on the elbows and knees. Below it, text reads: "Mild psoriasis covers less than 3 percent of the body."
-   **MODERATE:** A silhouette with larger red patches on the elbows, knees, and torso. Below it, text reads: "Moderate psoriasis covers between 3 and 10 percent of the body."
-   **SEVERE:** A silhouette with extensive red patches covering much of the arms, torso, and legs. Below it, text reads: "Severe psoriasis covers more than 10 percent of the body."]

-   **Topical:** Icon of a tube, representing topical creams.
-   **Phototherapy:** Icon of a sun with rays, representing light therapy.
-   **Biologics:** Icon resembling a DNA helix, representing biologic treatments.
-   **Orals:** Icon of a pill bottle with a pill, representing oral medications.]
                                                       First treatment option are topical therapies
                                                       such as creams, lotions and foams. The next
                                                       treatment option is biologics; these are
                                                       injectable treatments. In addition, we have
                                                       ultraviolet light therapy available. Finally,
                                                       we have our oral, or systemic, treatments
                                                       which are pills that patients take by mouth.

                                                       Dermatologists understand that psoriasis
                                                       can affect the quality of life. So, it is
                                                       important to have an open conversation
                                                       with your dermatologist so that we can
                                                       tailor the therapy to your needs.
