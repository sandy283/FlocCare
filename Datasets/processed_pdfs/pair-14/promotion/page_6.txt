Dr. Ted Lain:
DUOBRII is just a once a day medication. In
clinical trials, patients used DUOBRII Lotion
for 8 weeks. 41% of patients had clear or
almost clear skin by then, and some of them
saw results as early as 2, 4 or 6 weeks. In
addition, 33% of patients had clear or
almost clear skin one month after they
stopped using DUOBRII Lotion.
