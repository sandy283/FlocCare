Webpage

The webpage makes claims and presentations such as the following regarding the efficacy of
Duobrii (bolded and italicized emphasis original, underlined emphasis added):

    *    “**<u>Demonstrated synergy: superior efficacy</u> vs the aggregated results of two
         monotherapies**”
    *    A graph entitled, “Treatment success[6] at 8 weeks with the effect of the vehicle
         removed[7]”
         o    A bar graph that depicts “treatment success” as 42.8% for Duobrii Lotion and
              32.5% for the monotherapies aggregated, after the vehicle results are removed.
    *    “**More patients experienced treatment success[8] with DUOBRII Lotion than the
         aggregated success rates of both monotherapies**[9]”
    *    “**DUOBRII Lotion exceeded the clinical definition of synergy by 31.7% at 8 weeks**[10,11]”

The webpage creates a misleading impression regarding the efficacy and mechanism of
action of Duobrii because it draws conclusions based on data that are inadequate to support
such conclusions. The claims of “demonstrated synergy” and “superior efficacy” versus the
aggregated results of two monotherapies on the webpage are based on data derived from
post hoc analyses of a single phase 2 trial, of limited sample size, which compared Duobrii
separately to its individual components and vehicle. We acknowledge the statement, “Post
hoc analysis of a phase 2 clinical trial” is included on the webpage. However, this does not
mitigate the misleading impression created by these claims and presentations because the
phase 2 trial was not designed to support conclusions comparing the efficacy of Duobrii to its
aggregated components, minus the vehicle effect. Because this analysis was conducted post
hoc, there was no prespecified statistical procedure controlling for type 1 error rate (false
positive rate) in this phase 2 trial, so it is not possible to ascertain whether the findings were
attributable to treatment with Duobrii and its components, or merely due to chance. As a
result, these findings are exploratory (hypothesis-generating). Therefore, claims and
presentations that draw conclusions (e.g., “demonstrated synergy” and/or “superior efficacy”)
are misleading.

Furthermore, this presentation of data regarding the phase 2 trial is misleading because it
overstates the efficacy of the drug by inaccurately describing treatment success at 8 weeks.
Specifically, the claims and presentation imply that the difference in efficacy between Duobrii
and the aggregate of tazarotene and halobetasol (its individual components) was 10.3%,
