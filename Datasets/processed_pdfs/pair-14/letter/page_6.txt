Bausch Health Companies Inc.
NDA 209354/MA 178 and 221

when the absolute difference between Duobrii and the aggregate of its individual components
was only 0.6% in the actual topical lotion dosage form used in the phase 2 trial (52.5% vs
51.9%). In the trial, Duobrii and its components were administered topically in the same
vehicle lotion, which provided a 9.7% response rate. However, the webpage presents results
that were analyzed post hoc after the 9.7% vehicle lotion response rate was removed from
Duobrii and each of its individual components.¹² This webpage, therefore, presents a much
larger difference in efficacy between treatment arms than was actually demonstrated. As a
result, this presentation is misleading.

Conclusion and Requested Action

For the reasons discussed above, the video and webpage misbrand Duobrii within the
meaning of the FD&C Act and make its distribution violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(a), (n); 321(n);
331(a). See 21 CFR 202.1(e)(3)(i); (e)(5); (e)(7)(viii).
