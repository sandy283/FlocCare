This product is associated with a number of serious risks. Duobrii is contraindicated in
pregnancy. The PI also contains warnings and precautions regarding embryofetal risk,
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression and other unwanted systemic
glucocorticoid effects, local adverse reactions, photosensitivity and the risk for sunburn,
ophthalmic adverse reactions, and concomitant skin infections. The most common adverse
reactions reported with Duobrii were contact dermatitis, application site pain, folliculitis, skin
atrophy, and excoriation.

<u>Prior Communications</u>

OPDP expressed similar concerns (b) (4) On February 14, 2020, (b) (4) for Duobrii (b) (4)
(b) (4)
Bausch appears to be promoting Duobrii
without presenting the serious risks and efficacy of the drug in a truthful and non-misleading
manner, despite concerns previously expressed by OPDP.

<u>False or Misleading Risk Presentation</u>

Prescription drug advertisements and labeling (promotional communications) misbrand a
drug if they are false or misleading with respect to risk. The determination of whether a
promotional communication is misleading includes, among other things, not only
representations made or suggested in the promotional communication, but also the extent to
which the promotional communication fails to reveal facts material in light of the
representations made or with respect to consequences that may result from the use of the
drug as recommended or suggested in the promotional communication.

<u>Video</u>

The video is misleading because it includes efficacy claims for Duobrii but fails to include
important risk information associated with the drug. Specifically, the video fails to include
material facts regarding the warning and precaution for embryofetal risk. The WARNINGS
AND PRECAUTIONS section of the PI states the following (in pertinent part; emphasis
added):

        <u>Advise pregnant females of the potential risk to a fetus. Obtain a pregnancy test
        within 2 weeks prior to DUOBRII Lotion therapy. Initiate DUOBRII Lotion therapy
        during a menstrual period. Advise females of reproductive potential to use
        effective contraception during treatment with DUOBRII Lotion therapy.</u>

This omission is especially concerning given that the patient, who appears to be of child-
bearing age and is seen in the video with two young children, states (emphasis added), "I’ve
been using DUOBRII for 2 years, it works into my routine. I have cleared my plaque
psoriasis on my elbows. I didn’t have flaky skin, it wasn’t sore, it wasn’t red. <u>When I have a
flare up, I apply it.</u>” This claim suggests that a female of reproductive potential can initiate
Duobrii or use it whenever she has a psoriasis flare up without regard to the measures
needed to mitigate the risk of birth defects associated with Duobrii (i.e., obtain a negative
