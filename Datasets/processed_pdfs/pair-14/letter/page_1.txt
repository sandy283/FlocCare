RE: NDA 209354
    DUOBRII™ (halobetasol propionate and tazarotene) lotion, for topical use
    MA 178, 221

Dear Dr. Patel:

The Office of Prescription Promotion (OPDP) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has reviewed the promotional communications, a direct-to-consumer video and
corresponding storyboard (duo-0134-usa-20) (video) and the efficacy webpage¹ of the
healthcare professional website (duo-0318-usa-20) (webpage) for DUOBRII™ (halobetasol
propionate and tazarotene) lotion, for topical use (Duobrii), submitted by Bausch Health
Companies Inc. (Bausch) under cover of Form FDA 2253. The video was originally featured
on Lifetime TV’s The Balancing Act.² The video and webpage make false or misleading
claims and/or representations regarding the risks associated with and the efficacy of Duobrii.
Thus, the video and webpage misbrand Duobrii within the meaning of the Federal Food, Drug
and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and make its distribution violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(a), (n);
321(n); 331(a). See 21 CFR 202.1(e)(3)(i); (e)(5); (e)(7)(viii). These violations are concerning
from a public health perspective because the video fails to include information regarding
serious risks associated with Duobrii, a topical product that bears warnings and precautions
related to serious systemic risks and serious skin reactions. In addition, the video and
webpage create a misleading impression regarding the overall benefit a patient may expect
as a result of Duobrii treatment.

**Background**

Below are the indication and a summary of the most serious and most common risks
associated with the use of Duobrii.³ According to the FDA-approved product labeling (PI):

    DUOBRII™ (halobetasol propionate and tazarotene) Lotion, 0.01%/0.045% is indicated
    for the topical treatment of plaque psoriasis in adults.
