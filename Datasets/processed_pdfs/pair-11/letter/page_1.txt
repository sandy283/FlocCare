RE: NDA 211367
    SLYND (drospirenone) tablets, for oral use
    MA 40

Dear Dr. McNeil:

As part of its monitoring and surveillance program, the Office of Prescription Drug Promotion
(OPDP) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed a promotional
communication, a social media sponsored post (EXS-22-64 R00) (post), for SLYND
(drospirenone) tablets, for oral use (Slynd).¹ The post makes false or misleading claims and
representations about the risks and efficacy of Slynd. Thus, the post misbrands Slynd within
the meaning of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and makes its
distribution violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(a), (n); 321(n); 331(a). See 21 CFR 202.1(e)(5). In
addition, this material was not submitted at the time of initial dissemination or publication as
required by 21 CFR 314.81(b)(3)(i). These violations are concerning from a public health
perspective because the promotional communication fails to include any risk information,
which creates a misleading impression about the expected benefits and safety of Slynd.

Background

Below are the indication and summary of the most serious and most common risks
associated with the use of Slynd.² According to the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section of
the FDA-approved prescribing information (PI)³:

        SLYND is a progestin indicated for use by females of reproductive potential to prevent

cervical cancer, liver disease, ectopic pregnancy, risk of hyperglycemia in patients with
