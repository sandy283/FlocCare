**False or Misleading Risk Presentation**

Prescription drug advertisements and labeling (promotional communications) misbrand a
drug if they are false or misleading with respect to risk. The determination of whether a
promotional communication is misleading includes, among other things, not only
representations made or suggested in the promotional communication, but also the extent to
which the promotional communication fails to reveal facts material in light of the
representations made or with respect to consequences that may result from the use of the
drug as recommended or suggested in the promotional communication.

The post, titled “Slynd® (drospirenone),” is misleading because it presents claims and
representations about the benefits of Slynd but fails to communicate **any** risk information. By
omitting the risks associated with Slynd, the post fails to provide material information about
the consequences that may result from the use of Slynd and creates a misleading impression
about the drug’s safety.

**False or Misleading Claims about Efficacy**

Promotional communications misbrand a drug if they are false or misleading with respect to
efficacy. The determination of whether a promotional communication is misleading includes,
among other things, not only representations made or suggested in the promotional
communication, but also the extent to which the promotional communication fails to reveal
facts material in light of the representations made or with respect to consequences that may
result from the use of the drug as recommended or suggested in the promotional
communication.

The post includes the following claim (emphasis original):
* “**Offer your patients estrogen-free birth control with periods on a schedule.**”

This claim is misleading because it overstates the efficacy of Slynd by claiming patients will
have a “period,” or bleeding, that is predictable and “on a schedule” when this has not been
demonstrated. We note that, according to the CLINICAL STUDIES section of the Slynd PI, in
Study CF111/303, 81.2% of patients had scheduled⁴ bleeding in Cycle 1. However, this
**decreased** to 26.4% after 13 cycles of treatment with Slynd. Similarly, in Study
CF111/304, scheduled bleeding also **decreased** over time from 98.0% in Cycle 1 to 28.4% in
Cycle 13. Thus, the majority of patients did **not** experience “periods on a schedule” over the
duration of treatment with Slynd. Rather, “periods on a schedule” decreased. In addition,
Slynd is associated with bleeding irregularities and amenorrhea. According to the
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS section of the Slynd PI, “Females using SLYND may

⁴ Scheduled bleeding was defined as any bleeding or spotting that occurred during hormone-free intervals (days
25 to 28±1 day) and continued for up to eight consecutive days (i.e., a “period”, vaginal bleeding during a
menstrual cycle).
