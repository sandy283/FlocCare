experience unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting, especially during
the first three months of use. In fact, a large proportion of patients (40.3% and 52.2% in
Studies CF111303 and CF111304, respectively) still reported unscheduled⁵ bleeding after
13 cycles of treatment. Thus, “periods” and other occurrences of bleeding were **not** “on a
schedule.” Therefore, due to the majority of patients not experiencing scheduled bleeding (as
would be expected during a menstrual cycle) during treatment with Slynd and the large
proportion of patients still experiencing breakthrough bleeding, claims regarding Slynd
patients experiencing predictable or “scheduled periods” are not supported by the data. If you
have information or data to support periods occurring on a schedule, please submit to FDA
for review.

**Failure to Submit Under Form FDA-2253**

FDA regulations require any labeling or advertising devised for promotion of the drug product
to be submitted at the time of initial dissemination of the labeling and at the time of
initial publication of the advertisement for a prescription drug product. Each submission is
required to be accompanied by a completed transmittal Form FDA-2253 (Transmittal of
Advertisements and Promotional Labeling for Drugs for Human Use) and is required to
include a copy of the product’s current professional labeling. A copy of the post was not
submitted to OPDP under cover of Form FDA-2253 at the time of initial publication as
required by 21 CFR 314.81(b)(3)(i).

**Conclusion and Requested Action**

For the reasons discussed above, the post misbrands Slynd within the meaning of the FD&C
Act and make its distribution violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(a), (n); 321(n); 331(a). See 21 CFR
202.1(e)(5). Furthermore, Exeltis did not comply with 21 CFR 314.81(b)(3)(i).

This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you with an opportunity to address them.
OPDP requests that Exeltis cease any violations of the FD&C Act. Please submit a written
response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt, addressing the

submission date) for Slynd that contain representations such as those described above, and
explaining any plan for discontinuing use of such communications, or for ceasing distribution
of Slynd.

If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, please include in your
submission to us your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration within
15 working days from the date of receipt of this letter.

The concerns discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list of
potential violations. It is your responsibility to ensure compliance with each applicable
requirement of the FD&C Act and FDA implementing regulations.

⁵ Unscheduled bleeding was defined as bleeding or spotting that occurred while taking active hormones (days 2
to 23), except days which were classified as scheduled bleeding days.
