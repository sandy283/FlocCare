RE: [Redacted (b)(4)]
    Crenolanib besylate [Redacted (b)(4)]
    MA 2

Dear Dr. Puri-Lechner:

As part of its monitoring and surveillance program, the Office of Prescription Drug Promotion
(OPDP) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed Arog Pharmaceuticals
Inc.’s (Arog) booth display for its investigational new drug Crenolanib besylate [Redacted (b)(4)]
(Crenolanib) that appeared in the main exhibit hall at the American Society of
Hematology’s (ASH) 59th Annual Meeting.1 We have also reviewed a webpage2 for
Crenolanib titled, “Crenolanib A next-gen tyrosine kinase inhibitor for use in FLT3-mutated
AML.” The booth display and webpage suggest, in a promotional context, that Crenolanib, an
investigational new drug, is safe and effective for the purposes for which it is being
investigated or otherwise promote the drug. As a result, Crenolanib is misbranded under
section 502(f)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C) Act and in violation of
section 301(a) of the FD&C Act. The claims and presentations made on the booth display
and webpage are concerning from a public health perspective because they make conclusory
representations in a promotional context regarding the safety and efficacy of an
investigational new drug that has not been approved by the FDA and whose safety and
efficacy have not yet been established.

**Background**

Crenolanib is an investigational new drug for which there is no marketing authorization in the
United States [Redacted (b)(4)]
[Redacted (b)(4)]
[Redacted (b)(4)]
AML is characterized by the proliferation of myeloid precursors (blasts) with limited ability to
differentiate into more mature myeloid cells. These blasts replace normal blood cell-forming
tissue in the bone marrow, resulting in decreased numbers of red blood cells, white blood
