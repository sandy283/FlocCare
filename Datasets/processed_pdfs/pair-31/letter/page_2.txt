cells, and platelets. This decrease in normal blood cells results in the symptoms of AML,
which is universally fatal without treatment.

**Misbranding of an Investigational Drug**

Under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, a drug shall be deemed to be misbranded unless
its labeling bears adequate directions for use. Under FDA regulations, adequate directions
for use means directions under which the layman can use a drug safely and for the
purposes for which it is intended. 21 CFR 201.5. Your booth display and webpage describe
the use of Crenolanib in treating AML in general and FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3)
positive AML specifically. These uses are ones for which a prescription would be needed
because they require the supervision of a physician and, therefore, for which adequate
directions for lay use cannot be written.

Although 21 CFR 201.115(b) provides an exemption from the adequate directions for use
requirement in section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act if a new drug “complies with section 505(i)
. . . and regulations thereunder,” your investigational drug fails to do so.³ Among the
requirements for the exemption for investigational drugs, 21 CFR 312.7 provides that, “[a]
sponsor or investigator, or any person acting on behalf of a sponsor or investigator, shall not
represent in a promotional context that an investigational new drug is safe or effective for
the purposes for which it is under investigation or otherwise promote the drug. This
provision is not intended to restrict the full exchange of scientific information concerning the
drug, including dissemination of scientific findings in scientific or lay media. Rather, its intent
is to restrict promotional claims of safety or effectiveness of the drug for a use for which it is
under investigation and to preclude commercialization of the drug before it is approved for
commercial distribution.”

The booth display and webpage include claims and presentations that promote Crenolanib
as safe and effective for the purposes for which it is being investigated or otherwise promote
the drug, including the following:

**Booth Display**

*   Combination Therapy—Future of AML Treatment
    *   CRENOLANIB
        *   Combinable with chemotherapy at full doses

            ✓ PDGFRβ

³ 21 CFR 201.100 offers another exemption from the requirement for adequate directions for use for prescription
drugs provided certain requirements are met; however, Crenolanib does not fall within that exemption because it
is an investigational new drug for which there is not marketing authorization in the United States.
