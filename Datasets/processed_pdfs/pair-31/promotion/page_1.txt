**Description of Visual Elements:**

The background of the webpage displays a dark, abstract scientific illustration. It features large, interconnected molecular structures. Prominently in the mid-ground, there is a complex arrangement of spherical, brown-colored elements, possibly representing a cell membrane or a lipid bilayer, with some darker, rod-like structures extending from them. Interspersed within and around these brown structures are various amorphous, convoluted shapes in shades of blue and yellowish-brown, suggesting proteins or other biological molecules interacting with the membrane. The overall visual theme supports the pharmaceutical nature of the company and its products, likely illustrating molecular or cellular interactions.
