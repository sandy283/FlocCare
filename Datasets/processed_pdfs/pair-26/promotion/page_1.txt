ABBY – INTRO
We often see spots all over our bodies and wonder what they are and where they're
coming from so I'm finding out right now from dermatologist and spokesperson
for our sponsor, Aclaris Therapeutics, Dr. Doris Day.

1) ABBY: I think we all start to notice more and more spots on our skin as we age,
so what's the difference in some of the spots that appear?

There are many different types of skin spots but one of the most common is
seborrheic keratoses, also known as SKs. If they are SKs, they are harmless,
benign growths which can only be diagnosed by a health care provider. The spots
can be flat or raised with a color that is normal skin tone or darker. SKs can have a
velvety, shiny, or wart-like texture and grow thicker. SKs can appear anywhere on
your body – except for the palms, soles and mucous membranes. But they are most
common on the face, neck and hairline. They are also common on the chest and
back.

2) ABBY: How do you treat raised SK skin lesions?

**Visual Elements Description:**
*   A red arrow originates from the line break after "Therapeutics" (part of the speaker description for CG: Dr. Doris Day in the second question section) and points to a red rectangular box. Inside the box, the text reads: "Added "Paid"".

DR. DAY:
There's an in-office treatment, called ESKATA® that is a 40% hydrogen peroxide
topical solution approved to treat raised SKs. SKs are actually very common – in
fact, 83 million Americans have SKs, some of which are raised and some of which
are flat. ESKATA is the only FDA-approved topical treatment for raised SKs. So,
after a dermatologist makes the diagnosis, ESKATA can be applied to the raised
growth with a soft-tip pen-like applicator and the lesion may resolve over time
