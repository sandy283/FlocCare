**Prior Communications**

OPDP notes that our advisory comments dated March 29, 2018, addressed draft Aclaris
presentations for Eskata with certain similarities to the video in this letter. In these advisory
comments, OPDP recommended that Aclaris revise proposed presentations so that they did
not omit material information regarding the risks associated with Eskata or otherwise
misrepresent important risk information. We also recommended that Aclaris revise proposed
presentations so that they did not overstate the efficacy of Eskata. We are concerned that
Aclaris is promoting Eskata in a manner that fails to adequately present the serious risks of
the drug or describe the efficacy of the drug in a truthful and non-misleading manner despite
this direction from OPDP.

**False or Misleading Risk Presentation**

Promotional materials misbrand a drug if they are false or misleading with respect to risk.
The determination of whether promotional materials are misleading includes, among other
things, not only representations made or suggested in promotional materials, but also failure
to reveal facts material in light of the representations made or with respect to consequences
that may result from the use of the drug as recommended or suggested in the materials.

The video features a discussion with a physician who is a paid spokesperson for Aclaris
(Physician Spokesperson), as acknowledged both verbally and in text during the video. The
video contains claims and/or representations about the benefits of Eskata. However, as
described below, the video fails to include prominent, balancing risk information about
Eskata.

First, the video fails to reveal the serious risks that are reflected in the warnings and
precautions for the drug and are intended to be communicated to patients as described in
the PI and Patient Information (PPI). We acknowledge that in addition to the Physician
Spokesperson referring consumers to Eskata.com for more information, the video includes
superimposed text (SUPERs) listing the drug’s most common side effects and directing
consumers to Eskata.com for full safety and prescribing information. However, this does not
mitigate the video’s omission of the serious risk information regarding the warnings and
precautions about serious eye disorders that can result from unintended exposure and
about severe local skin reactions. By omitting the warnings and precautions associated with
Eskata, the video fails to provide material information about the consequences that may
result from the use of the drug and creates a misleading impression about the drug’s safety.
This misleading presentation is especially problematic from a public health perspective
given the serious and potentially permanent risks associated with the drug including the risk
for corneal injury such as erosion, ulceration, perforation, and scarring; chemical
conjunctivitis; eyelid edema; severe eye pain; or permanent eye injury, including blindness,
if there is inadvertent eye exposure, as well as the risk for severe local skin reactions
including erosion, ulceration, vesiculation and scarring.
