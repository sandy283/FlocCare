RE: NDA 209305
      ESKATA® (hydrogen peroxide) topical solution
      MA 56

Dear Ms. Matkowski:

The Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (OPDP) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has reviewed a direct-to-consumer video of an interview featuring a paid Aclaris
spokesperson regarding ESKATA® (hydrogen peroxide) topical solution (Eskata), as well as
the corresponding script (PP-ESK-US-0482) submitted by Aclaris under cover of Form FDA
2253. The video was originally broadcast on ABC’s *The View* on September 19, 2018,¹ and
can also be accessed through the Eskata Facebook page and the Aclaris LinkedIn page
(both last accessed June 14, 2019), both submitted by Aclaris under cover of Form FDA
2253. The video makes false or misleading claims and/or representations about the risks
associated with and the efficacy of Eskata. Thus, the video misbrands Eskata within the
meaning of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and makes its distribution
violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(a), (n); 321 (n); 331(a). See 21 CFR 202.1(e)(3)(iii), (e)(5). This
video is especially concerning from a public health perspective because it fails to include
information regarding the serious risks associated with Eskata, which bears warnings and
precautions related to the risks of serious eye disorders (such as permanent eye injury
including blindness) in the case of exposure to the eye and severe skin reactions including
scarring.

**Background**

Below are the indication and summary of the most serious and most common risks
associated with the use of Eskata.² According to the FDA-approved product labeling (PI)³:

      Eskata is indicated for the treatment of seborrheic keratoses (SK) that are raised.

The WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS section of the PI includes risk information
regarding eye disorders and local skin reactions. In addition, the most common adverse
reactions associated with Eskata are erythema, stinging, edema, scaling, crusting, and
pruritis.

² This information is for background purposes only and does not necessarily represent the risk information that
should be included in the promotional piece cited in this letter.
³ The version of the Eskata PI referred to in this letter is dated December 2017.
