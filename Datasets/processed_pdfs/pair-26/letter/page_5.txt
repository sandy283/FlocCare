                                                                                             Page 5

competes for the consumer’s attention. As a result, it is difficult for consumers to adequately
process and comprehend this contextual information. Therefore, these presentations are not
sufficient to mitigate the misleading impression that typically patients treated with Eskata will
achieve complete clearance of all raised SK lesions.

Furthermore, these claims and presentations are misleading because they suggest that more
patients will achieve complete clearance of their SK lesions than has been demonstrated.
Specifically, this presentation includes before and after images of patients depicting complete
clearance of their SK lesions in conjunction with a SUPER that states, in pertinent part:
*   “18% of patients experienced clearance of 3 out of 4 raised SKs treated with
    ESKATA vs 0% with vehicle (Day 106 end of study).”

Presenting images of patients depicting complete clearance, in conjunction with data for
clearance of at least 3 out of 4 lesions, while omitting data for clearance of 4 out of 4 lesions,
misleadingly suggests that these data apply to the results seen in the “before” and “after”
images when this is not the case. According to the PI, only 4% and 8% of subjects treated
with Eskata achieved clearance of 4 out of 4 SK lesions at Day 106 in clinical studies 1 and 2,
respectively.

Conclusion and Requested Action

For the reasons discussed above, the video misbrands Eskata within the meaning of the
FD&C Act and makes its distribution violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(a), (n); 321(n); 331(a). See 21
CFR 202.1(e)(3)(iii); (e)(5).

products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting
information for our consideration.
