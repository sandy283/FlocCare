According to the CLINICAL STUDIES, Adjunctive Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder
section of the PI, the primary endpoint evaluated in the two studies supporting Rexulti’s use
in the treatment of MDD was change from baseline to Week 6 in the MADRS. We note that
the mean MADRS total score was 27 at randomization. According to Table 12, in Study 1,
the least-squares mean change from baseline for the primary endpoint was -8.4 for the
Rexulti (2 mg/day) + ADT treatment group compared to -5.2 for placebo + ADT, with a
placebo-subtracted difference of -3.2 (95% unadjusted confidence interval [CI]: -4.9, -1.5).
Therefore, upon comparison with mean baseline, the placebo-subtracted difference of -3.2
equates to a reduction in depression symptoms of 11.9% from the mean baseline of 27 (3.2
divided by 27), far less than the 62% reduction claimed in the TV ad and banner.

Furthermore, although the TV ad and banner promote the 2 mg tablet, we applied the above
analysis from Study 1 to Study 2 to more fully consider the claims made. According to the PI,
Study 2 evaluated a 1 mg/day and 3 mg/day dose of Rexulti + ADT versus placebo + ADT for
the adjunctive treatment of MDD. Like Study 1, patients in Study 2 did not reach the 62%
reduction claimed. According to Table 12, in Study 2, the least-squares mean change from
baseline for the primary endpoint was -7.6 for the Rexulti (1 mg/day) + ADT treatment group
compared to -6.3 for placebo + ADT, with a placebo-subtracted difference of -1.3 (95% CI: -
2.7, 0.1). The placebo-subtracted difference of -1.3 equates to a change of 4.8% from the
mean baseline of 27 (1.3 divided by 27). The least-squares mean change from baseline for
the primary endpoint was -8.3 for the Rexulti (3 mg/day) + ADT treatment group compared to
-6.3 for placebo + ADT, with a placebo-subtracted difference of -2.0 (95% CI: -3.4, -0.5). The
placebo-subtracted difference of -2.0 equates to a change of 7.4% from the mean baseline of
27 (2.0 divided by 27). Therefore, as with Study 1, data from Study 2 also demonstrated a
significantly lower reduction in depression symptoms from the mean baseline (4.8% and
7.4%, respectively, as measured by MADRS) than the 62% reduction claimed in the TV ad
and banner.

OPDP acknowledges that the TV ad and banner include the SUPER “Individual results may
vary” (in pertinent part; TV ad, frame 9; banner, frame 4). However, this does not mitigate the
misleading impression created by the promotional communications of the magnitude of
benefit that patients can expect when taking Rexulti and an ADT.

**Conclusion and Requested Action**

For the reasons discussed above, the TV ad and banner misbrand Rexulti within the meaning
of the FD&C Act and make its distribution violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(a), (n); 321(n); 331(a).
See 21 CFR 202.1(e)(5).

This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you with an opportunity to address them.
OPDP requests that Otsuka cease any violations of the FD&C Act. Please submit a written
response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt, addressing the
concerns described in this letter, listing all promotional communications (with the 2253
submission date) for Rexulti that contain representations like those described above, and
