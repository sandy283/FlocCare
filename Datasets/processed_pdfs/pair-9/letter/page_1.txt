RE: NDA 205422
    REXULTI® (brexpiprazole) tablets, for oral use
    MA 772, 791

Dear Kateshia Brooks:

The Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (OPDP) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has reviewed the promotional communications, a direct-to-consumer (DTC) television
advertisement (TV ad), titled “REXULTI MDD 2023-B TV Ad - See the Signs”
(11US22EBC0039) and DTC banner (banner), titled “2023 MDD Consumer Campaign
Desktop Display Banners A” (11US23EBC0168) for REXULTI® (brexpiprazole) tablets, for

CFR 202.1(e)(5). This violation is especially concerning because major depressive disorder
(MDD), a debilitating and chronic illness, is a significant public health concern, and the
promotional communications create a misleading impression regarding the effectiveness of
Rexulti, a drug with multiple serious, potentially life-threatening or irreversible risks.

associated with the use of Rexulti.¹ According to the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section of
the FDA-approved prescribing information (PI) (in pertinent part):

       Rexulti is indicated for:

       • Adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults . . .

The PI for Rexulti contains boxed warnings regarding increased mortality in elderly patients
with dementia-related psychosis and increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in
patients aged 24 years and younger. Rexulti is contraindicated in patients with a known
