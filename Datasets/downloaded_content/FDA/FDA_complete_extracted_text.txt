Scope of FDA Authority
|  4 Hogan Lovells•Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), FDA has 
jurisdiction over medical device labeling [21 U.S.C. §352(a)] 
•FDA jurisdiction over advertising is limited to prescription drugs and 
restricted devices (designated as such by FDA, by PMA or regulation)
–FTC has primary jurisdiction over advertising of all other (non -restricted) 
medical devices
–FDA has consistently sought to expand its jurisdiction over advertising (of non -
restricted devices) by calling it labelingScope of FDA and FTC Authority
|  5 Hogan Lovells•Label : any display of written, printed, or graphic matter on the immediate 
container of any article, or any such matter affixed to any consumer commodity or 
affixed to or appearing upon a package containing any consumer commodity.
•Labeling: all written, printed, or graphic matter accompanying an article at any 
time while such article is in interstate commerce or held for sale after shipment or 
delivery in interstate commerce.
–No physical connection required –must just supplement or explain the article.
–Examples?
•Advertising is not specifically defined in the FDC Act
–Can include information in published journals, magazines, other periodicals, 
newspaper, and advertisements broadcast through media such as radio, television, 
and telephone communications systemsWhat AreLabeling and Advertising?
•SEC: Must give sufficient information to (prospective) shareholders, including 
about products in development 
–SEC requires a disclaimer of future looking statements, butthese often are seen by 
FDA as pre -approval promotion
•FDA shows some flexibility for corporate information presented to that audience
–Should be temporary –not enduring (usually 4 -6 months is long enough)
–Prospectus for an IPO should not use overly promotional language and should 
address things such as risk that FDA will not clear or approve a device, etc.
•Takeaways:
–Apply the truthful, non -misleading standard to avoid liability from either agency
–Separate section of the website
–Avoid promotional statements and remove investor materials (8Ks, etc.) from 
website after short periodFDA versus SEC Expectations
|  6 Hogan Lovells
Fundamental FDA Rules and Policies for Marketing
|  8 Hogan Lovells•Golden Rule: A medical device may be labeled and promoted only for 
its cleared or approved intended use(s)
–If 510(k) -exempt, labeling may not exceed the scope of the exemption as outlined by 
the classification regulation and the legally marketed exempt devices of that type
•Which of the following constitute “promotion”?
A.Posting your device’s labeling on a public website
B.Discussing your device’s capabilities on Facebook
C.Objectively answering a doctor’s question about your product’s intended use
D.Displaying a prototype of your product at a trade showGeneral Rules of Marketing and Promotion
|  9 Hogan Lovells•Devices are adulterated or misbranded when advertising/labeling creates a 
new intended use that requires premarket notification or approval [ FDCA §§
501(1); 502(o)]
•Adulteration means:
–Lack of premarket approval under FDCA §515(a) 
–Lack of Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) approval under FDCA §520(g)
•Misbranding means false or misleading in any particular [21 USC §352(a)], such as:
–Misstatement or omission of material facts
–Lack of fair balance (risk and benefit information)
–Lack of adequate directions for use
–Misleading representation with respect to another device [21 CFR §801.6]Adulteration and Misbranding
•Determination of intended use [21 C.F.R. §801.4]:
–Objective intent –expressions and circumstances
–All statements by company, written or oral, labeling, advertising, or on website
–FDA looks at all the surrounding circumstances in determining intended use
•If promoting for a new intended use, FDA may find that the new use 
requires a new 510(k) notice or a new PMA or PMA SupplementDetermination of Intended Use
|  10 Hogan Lovells
Marketing and Promotion of Unapproved Devices
Investigational Devices
•CANNOT represent the device as safe or effective, or imply that such 
characteristics have been established; 
•CANNOT promote or test market the device
•CAN disseminate limited information tailored to recruitment of clinical 
investigators and study subjects
–Must state the purpose is to recruit investigators or patients, not to make the device 
generally available
–Must prominently state: “Caution –INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE. LIMITED BY 
FEDERAL (OR U.S.) LAW TO INVESTIGATIONAL USE”
•CAN disseminate technical information ( e.g., specifications) in an objective, 
non-promotional context
12
•Display/promotion at a trade show is permitted under FDA Compliance Policy 
Guide (CPG) 300.600
–Only for the intended use that is the subject of the pending 510(k) notice
–Must include: “Pending 510(k), not available for sale within the United States.”
•Solicitation of purchase orders (commercialization) is prohibited
–Price information may not be disseminated
–Customer lists should not be generated
•This policy explicitly calls out devices after a 510(k) notice is submitted
•If FDA requires clinical data to support the 510(k) submission, follow the rules for 
displaying investigational devices insteadDevices with a 510(k) Submission Pending
|  13 Hogan Lovells
Claim Substantiation
|  15 Hogan Lovells•Claim = any statement tied to a device’s intended use and company’s purpose for 
selling it
•FDA may consider a claim false/misleading if not appropriately substantiated
–Data supporting a claim must be scientifically adequate ( i.e., statistically valid sample 
size, peer -reviewed, etc.), and typically submitted to FDA for formal review
–“Data on file” may support certain claims for cleared devices, but increasingly disfavored
–Disclose relevant facts relating to studies to give reasonable basis for assessment
•“Establishment” claims = express or implied statements describing the amount of 
support for a particular product claim
–Key rule enforced by multiple agencies: Company must have the form of substantiation 
alluded to by the claimClaim Substantiation
|  16 Hogan Lovells•FDA considers comparative claims inherently misleading, unless based on 
appropriate head -to-head testing.
–Includes superiority claims (assertions of better safety, performance, etc.)
–A device is misbranded if its labeling contains a false or misleading statement about 
another device
•Clinical comparative claims require head -to-head clinical data support evaluating 
the devices being compared in a scientifically valid study, where both devices are 
used for their on -label indications  
–Even where a company is comparing to a prior version of its own deviceComparative Claims
|  17 Hogan Lovells•Language noting 510(k) -cleared status of a device is allowable, unless 
presented in a way that would be considered misleading by implying: 
–(1) approval; 
–(2) FDA endorsement; or 
–(3) that clearance means anything beyond the fact that the device is legally marketed
•Promotional materials for a PMA -approved device may state “FDA -approved”
•Promotional materials cannot refer to a product’s registration and listing 
statusClaims about FDA Review Status
Your Turn!
|  18 Hogan Lovells

Off-Label Issues
|  20 Hogan Lovells•FDA has authority over medical device labeling and restricted device 
advertising; but FDA does not regulate the use of devices by physicians
•Under the FDC Act, physicians may use or prescribe a lawfully marketed
product for unlabeled uses as part of caring for an individual patient
–FDA avoids dictating to health care professionals how to practice their craft
–Where an HCP inappropriately commercializes/promotes , FDA can and has taken 
enforcement action
•Manufacturers cannot promote uncleared/unapproved uses of a device
–Sales representatives should be trained as to what is and is not within the scope foa
device’s clearance/approvalOff-Label Use and Practice of Medicine Exemption
Determining a Product’s Intended Use
•FDA looks at all the surrounding circumstances in determining intended use, 
including:
–Objective intent of manufacturer based on totality of expressions and circumstances
–All statements by company, written or oral, labeling, advertising, or on website
•If promoting for a new intended use, FDA may find that the new use requires a 
new 510(k) or new PMA or PMA Supplement
•2018 guidance on “consistency with labeling” somewhat broadens acceptable 
claims and evidentiary support for promotion of approved uses that are 
“consistent” with FDA -required labeling
–More relevant to PMA -approved devices
21
General versus Specific Uses
•Clearance/approval of a general indication does NOT allow for promotion of more 
specific indications ( e.g., regarding function, target population, etc.)
•Per General/Specific Intended Use guidance, to determine whether a specific use is 
covered by a general indication, interpret intended scope of the clearance/approval 
and whether the specific indication raises different/more severe risks
–For cleared devices, FDA generally sees the Indications for Use statement as the definitive 
scope of the clearance; for PMA -approved devices, scope is defined by the FDA -approved 
labeling
–Data used to support the clearance/approval may be key; language in the submission, 
approved labeling, and related correspondence may also be important
–If FDA has communicated to a company that it does not agree with using certain terms or 
claims, promoting the device along those lines increases risk of enforcement action
22
Your Turn –What is “Within the Scope” of Clearance?
•Hot Dog Patient Warming System is 510(k) -cleared “to prevent or 
treat hypothermia and to provide warmth to patients”
•Can the company include the following on its website?
❑“Unlike forced -air, air -free HotDog warming doesn't generate waste heat that 
can contaminate the sterile field. Hospitals that have switched to HotDog
report significant reduction in deep joint infections. For example, a #1 rated 
hospital in Minnesota experienced an 81% reduction after switching to air -free 
warming."
❑Use has been shown to reduce incidence of hypothermia in several clinical 
trials
❑Summary of an article published in a scientific journal, stating that it finds 
“74% reduction in implant infections” and “Researchers concluded air -free 
warming is recommended over forced -air warming for orthopedic procedures” 
23
What is “Within the Scope” of Clearance? 
•Can the company include the following on its website?
“Unlike forced -air, air -free HotDog warming doesn't generate waste heat that can 
contaminate the sterile field. Hospitals that have switched to HotDog report significant
reduction in deep joint infections. For example, a #1 rated hospital in Minnesota
experienced an 81% reduction after switching to air -free warming.”
×Infection reduction is a different intended use from preventing hypothermia, 
and would require supporting clinical data 
Use has been shown to reduce incidence of hypothermia in several clinical trials
Consistent with cleared indications for use; should provide adequate context
Summary of an article published in a scientific journal, stating it finds “74% reduction in 
implant infections” and “Researchers concluded air -free warming is recommended over 
forced -air warming for orthopedic procedures” 
×Infection reduction claim (albeit from third -party); exceeds scope of clearance
24

•A few “safe harbors” allow for manufacturers to lawfully disseminate ( not 
promote ) truthful, non -misleading information about off -label uses of their 
medical devices:
–Proactive dissemination to healthcare providers via FDA’s “ Good Reprints” practices 
guidance
–Reactive dissemination in response to an unsolicited request from a healthcare provider
–Sponsorship of independent Continuing Medical Education (CME) events
–“Scientific exchange”
•Off-label information disseminated via these pathways must be non -promotional, 
scientifically valid, objective, and fairly balanced
–FDA does not intend to consider such dissemination as evidence of the manufacturer’s 
intent to promote a device for off -label useDissemination of Off -Label Information
|  25 Hogan Lovells
•Recent 1stAmendment cases show a trend of supporting manufacturers’ truthful 
and non -misleading commercial speech, including discussion of off -label uses 
–United States v. Caronia (2d Cir. 2012)
–Amarin Pharma, Inc. v. FDA (SDNY Aug. 2015)
–Pacira Pharmaceuticals Inc. et al. v. FDA (SDNY Dec. 2015)
–Argued that broad indication for which a device was approved reasonably encompassed 
the specific uses for which itwas promoted
–U.S. v. Vascular Solutions, Inc. and Howard C. Root (WD Tex. Feb. 2016) 
–U.S.A. v. Facteau , et al. (D. Mass. July 2016)
•Important: Reliance on these cases is still very jurisdiction -and fact -specific.
•Case law also exists that conflict, with, or limits the application of, the above casesRecent First Amendment Case Law
|  26 Hogan Lovells
•There is a proposed rule to modify the definition of “intended use”
•If finalized, it would delete the last sentence in the current regulation which 
requires manufacturers to supply adequate labeling covering a new “effective” 
intended use (an off -label use) when they are aware of it
•Would also clarify that manufacturer knowledge (of off -label use) is only one 
source of evidence of what the manufacturer’s intent is, while maintaining FDA 
ability to rely on that as part of the totality of evidence of the intended useRecent Developments: FDA “Intended Use” Rule
|  27 Hogan Lovells
Payor Guidance
•June 2018 final guidance on manufacturer communications of health care 
economic information (HCEI) with payors, formulary committees, and similar 
–FDA defines an audience with appropriate knowledge and expertise to whom firms may 
provide HCEI, as long as it is “related to” a device’s cleared or approved indication
–Meaning related to the disease or condition, its manifestation, or symptoms associated 
with it in the patient population for which it is indicated in the FDA -approved labeling
–Greater leniency in what is disseminated to this tailored audience ( e.g., can discuss 
expected date of clearance to allow for budgeting)
•FDA stops short of permitting claims regarding unapproved uses, patient 
populations, doses, and situations that might shift the risk/benefit balance
28
Direct -to-Consumer (DTC) Advertising
•FDA is particularly concerned with promotional materials directed to lay 
consumers, because they may not have the specialized knowledge or training 
needed to appropriately utilize the information provided in these materials
•Primary rules generally align with those for promotion of any device:
–Content must be consistent with the cleared/approved indications for use
–All content must be truthful, accurate and current (i.e., not false or misleading]
–Specific claims and overall impression
–Material facts must be revealed
–Fair balance/presentation of risks and benefits
–All language used should be understandable to the target audience
•Beyond the general DTC promotional requirements, the FDCA sets forth specific 
requirements for DTC ads for restricted devicesDTC Promotion: General Requirements
|  30 Hogan Lovells
|  31•Testimonials utilized by a company are subject to the same requirements as if 
the company made the statements itself
•Testimonials must be consistent with the device clearance or approval
•Testimonials must represent results that a typical user might expect -can’t 
cherry pick the very best results 
–or must clearly and conspicuously disclose the generally expected performance in the 
depicted circumstances with adequate substantiation for that representation
–Not sufficient to use a disclaimer such as “results not typical” 
–The promotional material must convey fair balance of benefits and risks
•Numerous other requirements imposed by the FTCDTC Advertising:  Testimonials
|  32•The FTC Act prohibits “unfair or deceptive acts or practices” in advertising, 
including false advertisements (defined as “misleading in a material respect”) 
likely to induce the purchase of foods, drugs, cosmetics, or devices
–FTC looks at “representations made or suggested“, and at the extent to which an ad fails 
to reveal facts material in light of such representations with respect to consequences 
which may result from use of a product under the conditions prescribed in the ad, or
under such conditions as are customary or usual
•To substantiate health, safety, or efficacy claims, the FTC generally requires 
advertisers to possess “competent and reliable scientific evidence” 
•If disclosure of information is necessary to prevent an ad from being deceptive, it 
must be clear and conspicuous, and in appropriate proximity to the claim it 
modifiesFTC’s Purview: Deceptive or False Advertising
Monitoring Compliance; FDA and non -FDA Enforcement
What’s the Risk? FDA Enforcement Remedies
Informal outreach (e.g., e -mail, teleconference), questioning promotional practices 
is fairly common in CDRH’s new Total Product Life Cycle model
34Inspectional observations (FDA -483s)
Warning Letters and Untitled Letters
Product seizures
Administrative detention
Recalls (voluntary and mandatory)
Application Integrity Program
Refusing requests for 510(k) clearance or 
PMA approval of new products and PMA 
Supplements
InjunctionsCivil monetary penalties
Criminal fines/penalties
Equitable remedies (restitution, 
disgorgement)
Criminal prosecution of company/individual
Corporate integrity agreements
Import alerts
Exclusion from federal health care programs 
and debarment from government 
contracts/grants
What’s the Risk? Non -FDA Enforcement
•False Claims Act
–U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has authority to prosecute device manufacturers for 
off-label promotion
–Focus on promotional activities that result in submission of improper claims for 
Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement by healthcare professionals (i.e., for 
uncleared/unapproved uses of a device)
•FTC enforcement for false or misleading statements and unsubstantiated 
claims in advertising
•Lanham Act –unfair or deceptive trade practices
•State laws
35
•FDA considers website materials and social media to be labeling 
–Holds companies responsible for their sites just as for other promotional material
–A company is responsible for information it links to its website
•U.S. vs. OUS marketed products
–Portal page should direct to U.S. versus OUS sections                                                                        
of website if clearance/approval is not universal
–Disclaimers regarding U.S. regulatory status are not enoughInternet / Social Media Issues
|  36 Hogan Lovells

•Presenting risk information with space limitations and web page layouts
•Monitoring and responding to adverse events, complaints, customer service 
concerns generated by users
–e.g., "@COMPANY Can we talk about # sideeffects from your products? Please? 
#stillvomiting #nothappy #DRUGxx #FAIL" 
•Controlling employees’ and representatives’ comments and responses
•Need for and extent of monitoring user -generated content on corporate webpages 
or sites influenced by companies for potential off -label information
•User -generated content can be false, misleading or biased; blogs/comments allow 
others to influence the message
–Whether/how to correct third -party “misinformation” 
–Company is not responsible for truly independent content generated by usersUnique Challenges of Social Media Promotion
|  37 Hogan Lovells
•Fundamental violations cited are the same as in more traditional platforms
–Promotion outside scope of clearance 
–Promoting products for unapproved intended uses via links on a company site, search 
engines, meta -tagging, etc. 
–Promotion without any clearance/approval
–Misleading presentations, e.g., unbalanced presentation of risks and benefits
•FDA social media enforcement examples 
–“Liking” a Facebook comment about an uncleared/unapproved use (treating cancer)
–Company website designed such that product lists were brought up if a consumer typed 
diseases ( e.g., “diabetes”) into the product search field (and the product did not have 
corresponding approval)
–Sharing and retweeting third -party comments may also be considered endorsement by the 
companySocial Media Enforcement
|  38 Hogan Lovells
•Trade shows, scientific forums, detailers
–FDA monitors these activities and often attends events “in cognito ”
•Press Releases
–FDA permits more information than otherwise typically allowed in labeling, but 
restrictions still apply
–Must not state or imply that the device is approved or cleared for intended uses 
outside of the already cleared or approved indicationsOther Promotional Issues

implementing regulations grant the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) broad authority over drugs and devices
and their manufacturers’ activities, including labeling and
advertising
The FTC
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC)

The Federal Trade Commission Act (FTCA)
Prevents “ unfair or deceptive acts or practices”
Section 12 of the FTCA – “False advertisements for foods, drugs,
devices and services are prohibited.”
FDA vs. FTC: Who Has Jurisdiction?
Depends on
Type of product – drug or device
Nature of how it is sold

Advertisement vs. Labeling
Advertisements
(subject to 21 CFR 202)Promotional Labeling
(subject to 21 CFR 201)
Print advertisements in published
journals, magazines, other
periodicals and newspapers
Broadcast advertisements using
media such as radio, television and
telephone communication systemsBrochures, booklets, mailing pieces, detailing
pieces, file cards, bulletins, calendars, price lists,
catalogs, house organs, letters, motion picture
films, filmstrips, lantern slides, sound recordings,
exhibits, literature and reprints and similar pieces
of printed, audio or visual matter descriptive of a
drug and references published (for example, the
Physicians’ Desk Reference ) for use by medical
practitioners, pharmacists or nurses containing
drug information supplied by the manufacturer,
packer or distributor of the drug and that are
disseminated by or on behalf of its manufacturer,
packer or distributor
Drug Promotion
What Is Promotion?
Broadly interpreted
Includes materials and/or communications issued by or on behalf
of a company that inform, solicit or make representations to the
general public or the medical community
In some instances, even without mention of drug name,
statements may be viewed as promotion
Many Forms of Promotion
Print advertisements
TV advertisements
Company website
Certain interactions at
medical conventions or
product meetings
Physician detailing
session/sales calls
BoothsDirect-to-physician or
consumer mailings
Brochures/pamphlets
Internet advertisements
Certain oral or written
statements by company
employees or agents
The Basics
Labeling and Advertising
Product claims must be supported by substantial evidence
Product claims must be true and not misleading
Advertising and promotional materials must have fair balance
Advertising and promotional materials must contain a brief
summary of the approved PI
All promotion must be consistent with FDA-approved
labeling (no off-label promotion)
No pre-approval promotion
*
Proper Support
Claims must be supported by " substantial evidence " or
"substantial clinical experience "
"Substantial evidence" means "adequate and well controlled
investigations, including clinical investigations ... by experts qualified by
training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the
drug involved, on the basis of which it can fairly and responsibly be
concluded by such experts that the drug is safe and effective for such
uses." 21 C.F.R. § 202.1(e)(4)(ii)(b)
The explanation of "substantial clinical experience" is more limited. It
means "substantial clinical experience adequately documented in
medical literature or by other data (to be supplied to [FDA], if
requested), on the basis of which it can fairly and responsibly be
concluded by qualified experts that the drug is safe and effective for
such uses.” 21 C.F.R. § 202.1(e)(4)(ii)(c)
*
Truthful and Not Misleading
Product claims in promotion must be true and not presented in a
misleading way
Omitting material facts, i.e., "facts material in the light of ...
representations or material with respect to consequences which
may result from the use of the article to which the labeling or
advertising relates under the conditions of use prescribed in the
labeling or advertising thereof or under such conditions of use as
are customary or usual.” 21 U.S.C. § 321(n)
21 C.F.R. § 202 contains lists of ways in which a prescription
drug advertisement will or may be deemed to be false or
misleading
Fair Balance
FDA interprets fair balance to mean that the net impression of a
piece provides a balance of benefit and risk information
The quantity, location and order of risk information, including the use of
“signals”
Risk information exists in a hierarchical order as in the PI
A drug’s most serious risks and most common risks are material
Risk information can be considered to be minimized if formatting
makes the risk information harder to read than benefit information
Risk information needs to be written at an appropriate level for the
target audience (i.e., physicians versus patients)
Prescribing Information (PI) and Brief
Summary
Labeling must be accompanied by Full PI
Print advertising must include a true statement in Consumer
Brief Summary to include:
Information about side effects, contraindications, warnings and
precautions
Information that is in PI under headings such as cautions,
special considerations, important notes, etc.
Direct to consumer (DTC) advertising require PI information in
patient-friendly language and FDA Med Watch information
TV ads require major statement and adequate provision of PI
On-Label
Promotion must be consistent with the drug's labeling
Promotion of an off-label use is illegal
Prescription drug advertising "shall not recommend or suggest any use
that is not in the labeling” 21 C.F.R. § 202.1(e)(4)(ii)
Claim or statement about an FDA-regulated product that represents or
implies that the product is safe and effective in ways/for a population/for
a use/for a dosage that is not approved or cleared by the FDA
Statements, written or oral, or broadcast (express or implied) by the
manufacturer or its representatives suggesting a different than approved
use by FDA is unlawful and misbrands the product
Jan. 9, 2017 – FDA changes “intended use” definition in 21 C.F.R. §§
201.128 for the purposes of labeling from objective standard to totality of
the circumstance standard
An investigational drug may not be promoted for uses for which it is
under investigation 21 C.F.R. § 312.7
No Pre-Approval Promotion
Before FDA approval/clearance:
Cannot say a product is approved until the FDA sends the
approval letter to the company
Cannot say Product X is safe
Cannot say Product X is effective
Cannot imply either
Cannot make a claim that Product X is superior to another
product
A company cannot represent in ANY promotional
context that Product X is safe or effective
Promoting Product X prior to its approval violates
the law
Medical Device Promotion
Oversight of Medical Device Promotion
Jurisdictional Split
Labeling
FDA (through Center for Devices and Radiological Health)
Concept of “promotional labeling” not formally adopted by
CDRH
Has applied similar principles from drug world to medical
device promotional labeling materials
Advertising
FDA for advertising of restricted devices (Class III or others
restricted)
FTC for advertising of “nonrestricted devices” (Class I & II)
Medical Device Advertising
Unlike prescription drugs, not specifically defined in the FDCA or
regulations
The FDCA includes just two specific provisions regarding restricted
device advertising:
21 U.S.C. § 352(q) provides that a restricted device is misbranded if its
advertising is false and misleading in any particular, and
21 U.S.C. 352(r) provides that a restricted device is misbranded if its
advertising does not contain a brief statement of the device's intended
use and relevant warnings, precautions, side effects and
contraindications
Borrow from 21 CFR § 202.1 (1) Lists Examples of Drug
Advertisements
Advertisements in journals, magazines, periodicals, newspapers
Advertisement broadcasts such as on radio, TV, and phone
Unrestricted Device Advertising Specifically
FTC normally focuses on whether claims made for a product
aretruthful, non-misleading and substantiated by
“competent and reliable scientific evidence”
FTC
“Competent and reliable scientific evidence”
Tests, analyses, research, studies or other evidence based on
the expertise of professionals in the relevant area, which have
been conducted and evaluated in an objective manner by
persons qualified to do so, using procedures generally accepted
in the profession to yield accurate and reliable results
Substantiation
FTC Policy on Advertising Substantiation
The issue is notthe truth or falsity of the claim – it is the
failure to have and rely upon a reasonable basis that is
actionable
The advertiser must have at least the degree of
substantiation that it claims
Key is matching claims to evidence

What Are the Rules? FTC Truth in
Advertising Rules Also Apply
General principles:
All of the “old” rules still apply
“Clear and conspicuous” requirement applies
equally to all marketing channels
Clear, straightforward, accurate main messages
require fewer disclosures
Don’t bury important things in Terms of Use or
rely on disclosures
Regulator POV: If you can’t make a required disclosure in a
particular channel (such as Twitter), don’t use that channel for
that message!
Effectiveness of Disclosures – General Principles
The Four P’s: factors that affect whether disclosures are effective
Prominence – prominent enough to be seen and/or heard by consumers
Presentation – worded in a way that consumers can easily understand
Placement – where a consumer is likely to look
Avoid distracting factors!
For TV and video, disclosures should not be set against moving
backgrounds
Account for viewing on different devices and on different platforms
Optimize sites for smartphone/tablet use; if consumers have to zoom or
scroll, they may miss important disclosures
Proximity – “as close as possible” to the main claim it modifies (not just “near”
the claim)
Disclosures can be incorporated organically, which is equally effective!
Disclosures in Limited Spaces
If a disclosure is necessary
in a space-constrained ad
(for example, tweets), be
sure the disclosure appears
in each message
•You shouldn’t assume that a
consumer will see and
associate multiple messages
Make sure disclosures will
be maintained if republished
(for example, retweeted)
•If disclosure appears at end
of message, leave enough
free space so the disclosure
is not lost in republication
due to 140-character limit
Endorsements should be
clearly disclosed“When it’s not obvious that it is an ad,
people should disclose that they are being
paid… It only takes up two extra
characters.”
- Mary Engle, FTC

Facebook on the Forefront: Using Technology
for Compliance
•Added an automated scroll that
allows the small print warning of a
drug’s possible side effects to be
displayed
•Allows pharma companies to turn off
comments on pages promoting
specific products (allowing
companies to avoid reports of
unverified “adverse events”)
•Working to build up “community
pages” that bring together users who
share a particular medical condition,
which can be sponsored by drug
makers

Key Takeaways from Regulatory Guidance
Hyperlinks should be clearly labeled (e.g., productname.com/risks)
Benefits and risks must be accurately described – even when
symbols and shorthand are used
Each post stands alone (multiple tweets won’t do it)
Don’t force consumers to scroll: a disclosure should be as close to
the relevant claim as possible
Consider technological limitations – don’t rely on disclosures that
may not be accessible to consumers depending upon the device
they are using
Consider the risks of responding to third-party misinformation
